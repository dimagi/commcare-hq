# Supplementary Guide for Developers Running CommCare HQ on MacOS


## Prerequisites

- You will need `brew` aka [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for package management.

  **Big Sur:** see notes on running `brew` with Rosetta, aka `ibrew` below.


- It is highly recommended that you install a python environment manager. Two options are:

  - [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) (recommended) and `pyenv-virtualenv`

    ```sh
    brew install pyenv pyenv-virtualenv
    ```

    To create a new HQ virtual environment running Python 3.9.11, you can do the following:

    ```sh
    pyenv virtualenv 3.9.11 hq
    ```

    Then to enter the environment:

    ```sh
    pyenv activate hq
    ```

  - [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#introduction)

    Please note that if you use `virtualenvwrapper`, you also need to install `pip`

    To install `pip`:

    ```sh
    sudo python get-pip.py
    ```
    Then install `virtualenvwrapper` with `pip`:
    ```sh
    sudo python3 -m pip install virtualenvwrapper
    ```

- Java (JDK 8)

  We recommend using `sdkman` as a Java environment manager. `jenv` is also an option, though more involved.

    - Example setup using `sdkman`:

      1. [Install sdkman](https://sdkman.io/install)

      2. List available java versions to file one that matches Java (JDK 8)
         ```sh
         sdk list java
         ```
         Look for Java 8 in the list and install, eg:
         ```sh
         sdk install java 8.0.322-zulu
         ```

    - Example setup using `jenv`:

      1. Download and install [Java SE Development Kit 8][oracle_jdk8] from oracle.com downloads page.
         (requires signing in with an Oracle account to download).
      2. Install `jenv`

          ```sh
          brew install jenv
          ```

      3. Configure your shell (Bash folks use `~/.bashrc` instead of `~/.zshrc` below):

          ```sh
          echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.jenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
          echo 'eval "$(jenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
          ```

      4. Add JDK 8 to `jenv`:

          ```sh
          jenv add $(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8)
          ```

      5. Verify `jenv` config:

          ```sh
          jenv doctor
          ```

### Prerequisites: Notes for MacOs 11.x (Big Sur)

- It is recommended that you install Rosetta:
    ```sh
    softwareupdate --install-rosetta
    ```
    This allows you to install and run Brew services in x86 fashion.
    "Rosetta 2 is an emulator designed to bridge the transition between Intel and Apple processors. In short, it translates apps built for Intel so they will run on Apple Silicon." [Link](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3597949/everything-you-need-to-know-about-rosetta-2-on-apple-silicon-macs.html).
    While reading through this document, be careful to watch out for specific recommendations regarding your architecture.


- If `brew` cannot successfully build packages on your system, you can run `brew` with Rosetta under the alias `ibrew` using the method below.
    However, please try installing the latest version of `brew` first, as this might also be fixed for MacOS 11.x
    ```sh
    arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
    ```
    And let's call this Rosetta-enabled Homebrew `ibrew` for short by adding this to `~/.zshrc`:
    ```
    alias ibrew="arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew"
    ```

    Note: 12.x Monterey seems to be handling `brew` just fine when following the [official install guide](https://brew.sh).


## Issues Installing `requirements/requirements.txt`

- `psycopg2` will complain

  As of Mac OS 11.x Big Sur, the solution for this is:
  ```sh
  brew install libpq --build-from-source
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/lib"
  pip install psycopg2-binary
  ```
  
  Or try: ([reference](https://rogulski.it/blog/install-psycopg2-on-apple-m1/)). Used on Mac OS 12.X Monterey.
    ```sh
    export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@1.1/lib"
    export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@1.1/include"
  ```

### M1 Issues

- `gevent` may present errors when installing with Python <3.9. For this reason, you should avoid using an older version of Python unless it is required.

- `pynacl` will likely install but may throw an error `symbol not found in flat namespace '_ffi_prep_closure'` when attempting to run, particularly when setting up CommCare-Cloud.

  This can be fixed by installing a version of `pynacl` specific to the system architecture:
  ```sh
  arch -arm64 pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall pynacl
  ```


## Docker

Docker images that will not run on Mac OS (Intel or M1):

- `formplayer` (See section on Running Formplayer Outside of Docker in the [Main Developer Setup Guide](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/DEV_SETUP.md))

Docker images that will not run on Mac OS (as of 11.x Big Sur and above):

- `elasticsearch2`
- `elasticsearch5`

### M1 (OS 11.x and above) Recommended Docker Up Command

```sh
./scripts/docker up -d postgres couch redis zookeeper kafka minio
```

Note: `kafka` will be very cranky on start up. You might have to restart it if you see `kafka` errors.
```sh
./scripts/docker restart kafka
```

### Installing and running Elasticsearch 2.4.6 outside of Docker

First, ensure that you have Java 8 running. `java -version` should output something like `openjdk version "1.8.0_322"`.
Use `sdkman` or `jenv` to manage your local java versions.

Download the `tar` file for [elasticsearch 2.4.6](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-2-4-6)

Un-tar and put the folder somewhere you can find it. Take note of tha path (`pwd`) and add the following to your `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
export PATH="/path/to/elasticsearch-2.4.6/bin:$PATH"
```
NOTE: Make sure that `/path/to` is replaced with the actual path!

After this you can open a new terminal window and run elasticsearch with `elasticsearch`.

#### Install Elasticsearch plugins

Now that you have Elasticsearch running you will need to install the necessary plugins:

1. Install the plugin

    ```shell
    $ plugin install analysis-phonetic
    ```

    (If the `plugin` command is not found you will need to use the full path `<es home>/bin/plugin`).

2. Restart the service

3. Verify the plugin was correctly installed

    ```shell
    $ curl "localhost:9200/_cat/plugins?s=component&h=component,version
    analysis-phonetic 2.4.6
    ```

## Fixing ImportError with `libmagic`

If you are sure that the following `brew install libmagic` ran successfully, but you are still seeing the error below, then this section is for you!
```sh
ImportError: failed to find libmagic.  Check your installation
```

As of Mac OS 12.x, `brew` now installs itself in `/opt/homebrew/`, and it looks like our version of the python package that requires `libmagic` has not caught up.

To fix:
```sh
cd /usr/local/lib/
ln -s /opt/homebrew/Cellar/libmagic/5.41/lib/libmagic.dylib libmagic.dylib
```

## Refreshing data in `elasticsearch` manually (alternative to `run_ptop`)

FYI, be sure to check out the [FAQ on elasticsearch](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/DEV_FAQ.md#elasticsearch).

To refresh specific indices in elasticsearch you can do the following...

First make sure everything is up-to-date
```sh
./manage.py ptop_preindex --reset
./manage.py ptop_es_manage --flip_all_aliases

./manage.py preindex_everything
```

Force a re-index of `forms` and `cases`:
```sh
./manage.py ptop_reindexer_v2 sql-case --reset
./manage.py ptop_reindexer_v2 sql-form --reset
```

For other indices see `./manage.py ptop_reindexer_v2 --help`
