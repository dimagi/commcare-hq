"""Migrate attachments from couchdb to an external blob store

## Running migrations

Use the `run_blob_migration` management command to transfer attachments
on selected models from couchdb to the external blob database. Run the
command without arguments to get a list of possible migrations that
can be run:

    ./manage.py run_blob_migration

The migration may be done automatically when running `./manage.py migrate`
if there are only a few documents to be migrated. However, if there are
many documents to be migrated then the normal migration process will
stop and propmpt you to run the blob migration manually before
continuing with the normal migration process.

## Writing new migrations

Complete each of the following steps when migrating a new set of couch
models' attachments to the blob database:

1. Add `BlobMixin` as a base class of each couch model with attachments
   to be migrated to the blob database. For each new `BlobMixin` model:

   a. The mixin must come before `Document` in the list of base classes.
   b. Add `migrating_blobs_from_couch = True` to the class.
   c. Adapt any uses of the `_attachments` property to use `blobs`
      instead (this is more than a simple find and replace; see
      `corehq.blobs.mixin` for details).

2. Add a `Migrator` instance to the list of `MIGRATIONS` in
   `corehq/blobs/migrate.py`. It will look something like
   `Migrator("<your_slug>", [<list of new BlobMixin couch models>])`.
   Don't forget to add a test to verify that your migration actually
   works.

3. Deploy.

4. Run the management command to migrate attachments out of couch:
   `./manage.py run_blob_migration <your_slug>`

5. Remove `migrating_blobs_from_couch = True` from each of your
   `BlobMixin` models.

6. Create a new django migration with the `makemigrations` management
   command:
   ```
   ./manage.py makemigrations --empty blobs
   ```
   Then modify the new migration, adding an operation:
   ```
   operations = [
       HqRunPython(*assert_migration_complete("<your_slug>"))
   ]
   ```
   Don't forget to put
   ```
   from corehq.blobs.migrate import assert_migration_complete
   from corehq.sql_db.operations import HqRunPython
   ```
   at the top of the file.

7. Deploy.

That's it, you're done!
