class CODES:
    """Blob type codes.

    A unique blob type code should be assigned to each new area of HQ
    that will have blobs associated with it. This is mainly intended for
    analysis purposes (how much blob storage is used per type code?),
    although it is also useful when debugging to trace a blob identifier
    back to its parent.

    When adding codes for new models, always use a unique code that has
    never been used before, preferably one more than the highest
    existing code. Once a type code has been used it should never be
    reused for another purpose.

    Each type code associated with couch documents should only reference
    document types living in a single couch database or SQL models with
    non-overlapping primary keys. `MetaDB.get` and related methods as
    well as tools like the `check_blob_logs` management command will not
    function properly if this contract is broken.
