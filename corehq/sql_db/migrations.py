    This is useful for apps that have both partitioned and non-

    added to `TEST_NON_SERIALIZED_APPS` (see dev_settings.py) if model
    creations will be partitioned.

    May be applied to entire migration class (as decorator) or to individual
    migration operations (as wrapper).

    that should be applied to the shard dbs, but not to the proxy. It
    will be necessary to wrap migration operations individually if some
    should be applied to the proxy (table modifications) while some should
    only be applied to shard dbs (function modifications).
