Hey,

I'm emailing you because I noticed that you work for Dimagi, and you're a
member of project space fake-project. fake-project has had a lot of
submissions lately.

If this is a test project space, go to the internal project settings page
and change the "Real Project" setting to "Test" and I'll
stop bothering you.

Thanks!
CommCare HQ
