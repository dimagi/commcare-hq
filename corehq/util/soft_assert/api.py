    send an email with stack trace if assertion is not True

    Parameters:
    - to: Email address or list of email addresses that should receive the email
    - notify_admins: Send to all admins (using mail_admins) as well
    - fail_if_debug: if True, will fail hard (like a normal assert)
      if called in a developer environment (settings.DEBUG = True).
      If False, behavior will not depend on DEBUG setting.
    - exponential_backoff: if True, will only email every time an assert has
      failed 2**n times (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 times, etc.). If False, it will email
      every time.
    - skip_frames: number of frames of the traceback (from the bottom)
      to ignore. Useful if you're calling this from within a helper function.
      In that case if you want the call _to_ the helper function to be the
      last frame in the stack trace, then pass in skip_frames=1.
      This affects both the traceback in the email as the "key" by which
      errors are grouped.
    - log_to_file: write the message to a log file

    For the purposes of grouping errors into email threads,
    counting occurrences (sent in the email), and implementing exponential
    backoff, errors are always grouped by a key that varies on the
    last two frames (that aren't skipped by skip_frames) of the stack.

    Returns assertion. This makes it easy to do something like the following:

        if not soft_assert(to=['me@mycompany.com']).call(
                isinstance(n, float), 'myfunction should be passed a float'):
            n = float(n)

    etc.
