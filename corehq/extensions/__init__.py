CommCare Extensions
===================

This document describes the mechanisms that can be used to extend CommCare's functionality. There are a number
of legacy mechanisms that are used which are not described in this document. This document will focus on
the use of pre-defined *extension points* to add functionality to CommCare.

Where to put custom code
------------------------
The custom code for extending CommCare may be part of the main `commcare-hq` repository or it may have its own
repository. In the case where it is in a separate repository the code may be 'added' to CommCare by cloning the
custom repository into the `extensions` folder in the root of the CommCare source:

::

    /commcare-hq
      /corehq
      /custom
      ...
      /extensions
        /custom_repo
          /custom_app1/models.py
          /custom_app2/models.py

Extensions Points
-----------------
The `corehq/extensions` package provides the utilities to register extension points and their implementations
and to retrieve the results from all the registered implementations.

Create an extension point
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    from corehq import extensions

    @extensions.extension_point
    def get_things(arg1: int, domain: str, keyword: bool = False) -> List[str]:
        '''Docs for the extension point'''
        pass


    @extensions.extension_point
    def get_other_things():
        '''Default implementation of ``get_other_things``. May be overridden by an extension'''
        return ["default1", "default2"]

The extension point function is called if there are no registered extensions or none that match
 the call args.

Registering an extension point implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    from xyz import get_things

    @get_things.extend()
    def some_things(arg1, domain, keyword=False):
        return ["thing2", "thing1"]


Extensions may also be limited to specific domains by passing the list
of domains as a keyword argument (it must be a keyword argument). This is only supported
if the extension point defines a `domain` argument.

::

    from xyz import get_things

    @get_things.extend(domains=["cat", "hat"])
    def custom_domain_things(arg1, domain, keyword=False):
        return ["thing3", "thing4"]


Calling an extension point
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An extension point is called as a normal function. Results are
returned as a list with any `None` values removed.

::

    from xyz import get_things

    results = get_things(10, "seuss", True)


Formatting results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By default the results from calling an extension point are returned as a list
where each element is the result from each implementation:

::

    > get_things(10, "seuss", True)
    [["thing2", "thing1"], ["thing3", "thing4"]]

Results can also be converted to a flattened list or a single value by passing
a `ResultFormat` enum when defining the extension point.

**Flatten Results**

::

    @extensions.extension_point(result_format=ResultFormat.FLATTEN)
    def get_things(...):
        pass

    > get_things(...)
    ["thing2", "thing1", "thing3", "thing4"]

**First Result**

This will return the first result that is not None. This will only call the extension
point implementations until a value is found.

::

    @extensions.extension_point(result_format=ResultFormat.FIRST)
    def get_things(...):
        pass

    > get_things(...)
    ["thing2", "thing1"]
