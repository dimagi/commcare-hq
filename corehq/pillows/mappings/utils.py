    WARNING: this will not necessarily return the mapping the index was created
    or updated with. The `/<index>/_mapping[/<doc_type>]` request only returns
    fields present in documents which have been _indexed so far_. If you create
    a new index and immediately fetch its mapping, the mapping will be empty. If
    you add documents and then fetch the mapping for those document's type, the
    mapping will only contain fields which were present in the indexed
    documents, and still lack the other fields that were included when the index
    was created.  The docs suggest that the `include_defaults` parameter will
    'cause the response to include default values, which are normally
    suppressed', but not only does that not help with this problem, it doesn't
    even do what it claims to do (defaults are still suppressed, for example:
    "index": "analyzed", "type": "object", etc).
