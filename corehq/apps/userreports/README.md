User Configurable Reports
=========================

Some rough notes for working with user configurable reports.

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to start with sample data and reports.

First copy the dimagi domain to your developer machine.
You only really need forms, users, and cases:

```
./manage.py copy_domain https://<your_username>:<your_password>@commcarehq.cloudant.com/commcarehq dimagi --include=CommCareCase,XFormInstance,CommCareUser
```

Then load and rebuild the data table:

```
./manage.py load_spec corehq/apps/userreports/examples/dimagi/dimagi-case-data-source.json --rebuild
```

Then load the report:

```
./manage.py load_spec corehq/apps/userreports/examples/dimagi/dimagi-chart-report.json
```

Fire up a browser and you should see the new report in your domain.
You should also be able to navigate to the edit UI, or look at and edit the example JSON files.
There is a second example based off the "gsid" domain as well using forms.

The tests are also a good source of documentation for the various filter and indicator formats that are supported.


Inspecting database tables
--------------------------

The easiest way to inspect the database tables is to us the sql command line utility.
This can be done by runnning `./manage.py dbshell` or using `psql`.
The naming convention for tables is: `configurable_indicators_[domain name]_[table id]`.
In postgres, you can see all tables by typing `\dt` and use sql commands to inspect the appropriate tables.
