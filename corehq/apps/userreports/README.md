User Configurable Reports
=========================

Some rough notes for working with user configurable reports.

To rebuild a table just call the `rebuild_indicators` function in `tasks.py`.

The easiest way to create a table is to do it manually in the database.
This will hopefully get easier soon.
For inspiration, look at the example configuration files in tests/data/configs/.
