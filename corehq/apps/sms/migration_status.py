*** Halting migrate command because one or more messaging postgres migrations
have not yet completed.

In order to continue, switch into your code root (and virtual environment if
you have one), and do the following:

git fetch origin
git checkout {{ tag_name }}
git submodule update --init --recursive
find . -name "*.pyc" -delete # (linux command to delete .pyc files - adjust appropriately for your platform)
{% for command in commands %}python manage.py {{ command }}
{% endfor %}

You can then checkout the branch you were previously on (master, presumably),
update submodules, clean *.pyc files, and run python manage.py migrate normally.

NOTE: If you are seeing this on a fresh install of CommCareHQ, then you can
ignore the above. Instead, the first time you run migrate, run it with the
following command (this command assumes a linux environment - for other platforms
you just need to run python manage.py migrate with a temporary environment
variable CCHQ_IS_FRESH_INSTALL set to 1):
    env CCHQ_IS_FRESH_INSTALL=1 python manage.py migrate
""")
