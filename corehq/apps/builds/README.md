Adding CommCare Builds to CommCare HQ
=====================================

* First you need to get the CommCare build off the Dimagi build server:
    1. Go here http://build.dimagi.com:250/ and click [Login as a Guest User](http://build.dimagi.com:250/guestLogin.html?guest=1)
    2. Pick the branch you want and click on the link (e.g. "CommCare 1.3")
    3. Pick a build (probably the first one in the table) and write down
       the build number (under "#"). This will be referenced as `$build_number`
       below
    4. Click on "Success" in that row (under "Results")
    5. Select the "Build Parameters" tab and write down the version (all
       the way at the bottom in the "Environment Variables" table.) This will
       be referenced as `$version` below
    6. Select the "Artifacts" tab and click on "Download all (.zip)" on the
       right hand side. Note the path of the downloaded file. This will be
       referenced as `$build_path` below
* Now `cd` into the commcare-hq root directory, and run the following command:
  `python manage.py add_commcare_build $build_path $version $build_number`

Now make sure the build is available in the app settings.  Go to `/builds/edit_menu/`, then add the version and a label. You can also set the default here to be the version you've added.

Finally, in order to get full permissions on a J2ME phone, you need to set up jar signing. To do so, you will need
acquire a code signing certificate (from e.g. Thawte).

* To enable jar signing, put your certificate information in localsettings.py as follows:

<!-- language: lang-py -->

    JAR_SIGN = dict(
        key_store = "/PATH/TO/KEY_STORE",
        key_alias = "KEY",
        store_pass = "*****",
        key_pass = "*****",
    )

* If you don't need this, skip this step by commenting out the code entirely:

<!-- language: lang-py -->

    #JAR_SIGN = dict(
    #    key_store = "/PATH/TO/KEY_STORE",
    #    key_alias = "KEY",
    #    store_pass = "*****",
    #    key_pass = "*****",
    #)

You're done!


Sending to an Android Phone
===========================

If you would like to use a url or barcode scanner to download the application
to your phone here is what you need to setup.

### Make sure your local django application is accessible over the network

The django server will need to be running on an ip address instead of localhost.
To do this, run the application using the following command, substituting your
local IP address.

`./manage.py runserver 192.168.1.5:8000`

Try accessing this url from the browser on your phone to make sure it works.

### Make CommCare use this IP address

The url an application was created on gets stored for use by the app builder
during site creation. This means if you created a site and application
previously, while using a 'localhost:8000' url, you will have to make a code
tweak to have the app builder behave properly.

The easiest way to check this is to see what url is shown below the barcode on
the deploy screen.

If it is currently displaying a `localhost:8000/a/yourapp/...` url then open
`submodules/dimagi-utils-src/dimagi/utils/web.py` and change the line defining
the IP address (at line 22 at time of writing this, but may have changed).

Delete this line:

    return '%s://%s' % (protocol, Site.objects.get(id = settings.SITE_ID).domain)

And replace it with:

    ip_address = '192.168.1.4' # use your local ip address here
    return '%s://%s:8000' % (protocol, ip_address)

### Try it out

With this set up, you should be able to scan the barcode from your phone to
download and install your own locally built CommCare application!
