                    Our first solution, CommCare Supply (formerly known as
                    "CommTrack"), is designed to strengthen logistics and
                    supply chain for any frontline program, even those
                    that don't normally think of themselves as
                    'logistics people'.

                    Designed to support health workers and other mobile
                    agents who manage commodities, CommCare Supply is
                    used for inventory management, resupply, and delivery.

                    It was built based on the experiences deploying
                    three national-scale systems with John Snow
                    International, including ILSGateway in Tanzania,
                    the Early Warning System in Ghana, and cStock
                    in Malawi.
