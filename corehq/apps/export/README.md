# Exports

### Architecture

Exports are designed to build off the corresponding application to generate a schema that represents the
questions, properties, and system properties that are available to the user to select.
There is exactly one schema for each Application/Form pair or Case Type in a domain.
On initial generation of an export schema, the export will be generated by only taking into account the current
or "live" application. If the user chooses to view deleted questions, it will iterate through each built
application that has `has_submissions` set to True.

Example:

Suppose there exists the following app builds

| app_id | build_version | questions |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| 1234   | 12 (current)  | q1,q2,q4  |
| 1234   | 10            | q1,q3     |
| 1234   | 1             | q1,q2,q3  |

Below illustrates what the schema will look like after processing each app from beginning to current.
The example schema is simplified for understanding. Each question has an app_id and version associated with it.

After processing build_version 1:

```
q1.last_occurences = { app_id: 1 }
q2.last_occurences = { app_id: 1 }
q3.last_occurences = { app_id: 1 }
```

After processing build_version 10:

```
q1.last_occurences = { app_id: 10 }
q2.last_occurences = { app_id: 1 }
q3.last_occurences = { app_id: 10 }
```

After processing build_version 12 (current version, not necessarily built):

```
q1.last_occurences = { app_id: 12 }
q2.last_occurences = { app_id: 12 }
q3.last_occurences = { app_id: 10 }
q4.last_occurences = { app_id: 12 }
```

The export that is then generated will look something like this:

| question | is selected (by default) | is marked deleted | is hidden from user |
|------|---|---|---|
| q1 | ✓ |  |  |
| q2 | ✓ |  |  |
| q3 | | ✓ | ✓ |
| q4 | ✓ |  |  |

Since q3's latest build_version is 10, the code deduces that it has been deleted and therefore hides it and marks
it as deleted.

### Exporting remote apps / defining your own schema

In order to export remote apps, you will need to define your own schema for the export since there are no forms
and modules to build the export off of.

To enable the ability to do this turn on the toggle:

```
ALLOW_USER_DEFINED_EXPORT_COLUMNS ('Allows users to specify their own export columns')
```

The UI will then enable you to add columns and tables with a blank textbox to add a path. Paths are specified in
a dot notation.

Support the form looked like this:

```
<data>
  <question1></question1>
<data>
```

To specify this in `.` notation, it'd look like this in the schema:

```
form.question1
```

If you need to specify a repeat group and the form looks like this:

```
<data>
  <repeat>
    <question1></question1>
  </repeat>
</data>
```

The table path for this repeat would be:

```
form.repeat[]
```

Note the `[]` after the question. This tells the schema that it is a repeat group.

Any columns added to this table will need to be prefixed with this path. So a column in the table would be:

```
form.repeat[].question1
```

### System Properties

System properties are properties that CommCare HQ adds to the form or case that are essentially meta data. Examples
of these include: form id, case type, case id, form xmlns, etc. System properties are added to a white list. This
means that by default a system property on the form will _not_ be added to the export for selection. A list of the
system properties can be found
in [corehq/apps/export/system_properties.py](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/export/system_properties.py)

### Optimizations

Often times iterating through each build in an application can be time consuming. To reduce the time to process an
application, the code only processes applications that have been marked as having submissions.

### Caveats and edge cases

- Unknown deleted questions: It is possible to have an export where there lists properties that do not have any
  data associated with them. This case can arise when adding a question, `q1`, to the current application (without
  making a build), opening an export (to kick off the processing of the current application), then deleting `q1`
  before making a build. `q1` will now always be in the schema but will be shown as deleted.
