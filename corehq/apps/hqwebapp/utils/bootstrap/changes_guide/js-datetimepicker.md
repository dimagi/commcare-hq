The `datetimepicker` plugin has a new version corresponding to Bootstrap 5.

Our old date/time picker is tied to Bootstrap 3. It has a new version that is compatible with Bootstrap 5.
Like the old picker, the new picker can be used for picking a date, a time, or both a date and a time.
It also supports date ranges.
