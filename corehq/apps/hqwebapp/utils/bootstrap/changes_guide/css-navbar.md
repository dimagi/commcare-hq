`navbar` has been entirely rewritten in flexbox with improved support
for alignment, responsiveness, and customization.

- Responsive navbar behaviors are now applied to the `navbar` class via the required
`navbar-expand-{breakpoint}`` where you choose where to collapse the navbar.
Previously this was a Less variable modification and required recompiling.
- A `container` within is now required
