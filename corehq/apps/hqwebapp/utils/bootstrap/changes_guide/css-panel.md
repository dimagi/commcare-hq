`panel` has been dropped in favor of a new component `card`

We attempted a basic find-replace of css classes that have equivalents,
including classes we had to re-create.

However, there has been some restructuring to the `card` element itself that
might not be entirely translatable this way. Please review and adjust
accordingly.
