  # The build_requirejs script creates a bundle in each javascript directory that is
  # named bundle.js and includes all files in that directory. The modules below are
  # for additional bundles and bundles that don't fit that logic.

  # Any bundle that appears in a javascript module's dependency list must map to an actual file.
  # Otherwise, development environments will break.
