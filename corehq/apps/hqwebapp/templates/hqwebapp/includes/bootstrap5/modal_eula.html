                            Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Business Agreement, and Acceptable Use Policy
                    </a>
                    (collectively, "Terms") went into effect. We made these updates to clarify our terms and address
                    some new privacy laws in Europe. The spirit of our previous terms remains unchanged and,
                    as always, you are the owner of your data.

                    agree to our new Terms, you may choose to stop using our services. Before doing so, however,

                    We're here to answer any questions you have. Again, our updates are intended to reflect the
                    spirit of our previous terms.
