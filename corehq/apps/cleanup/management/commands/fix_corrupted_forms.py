    Original problem: `source = utf8_bytes.decode('latin1')`

    The theory of the fix is that any non-ASCII UTF-8 character decoded
    as Latin-1 would end up as multiple Latin-1 characters, all being
    "unprintable" characters having a 1 as their most significant
    bit. This works because Latin-1 is a single-byte encoding (each
    character is encoded as a single 8-bit byte), while UTF-8 is a
    variable-width encoding where each character is encoded with 1 to 4
    bytes, and all bytes of multi-byte code points have a 1 as their
    most significant bit. Since the source string is XML, all non-ASCII
    character sequences will be followed by an XML delimiter, which
    always ends with a printable ASCII character (`>`).
