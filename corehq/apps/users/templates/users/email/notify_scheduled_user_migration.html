    We have scheduled a migration to be run on {{ scheduled_date }} that will impact your CommCare user. Your
    organization has requested that your user, {{ old_username }}, be migrated to a new user with the username
    {{ new_username }}.

    The following data will be copied to your new user:
    <ul>
      <li>General user data (name, phone number, email, etc.)</li>
      <li>Project space memberships (including roles and locations)</li>
      <li>Saved reports</li>
      <li>Scheduled reports</li>
    </ul>

    The following data will not be copied to your new user:
    <ul>
      <li>API keys</li>
      <li>Pending CommCare invitations</li>
    </ul>

    Additionally, your password will be reset for your new user, and 2FA will be disabled by default. If you are exempt
    from SSO, you will be able to follow the <i>Forgot Password</i> workflow to log in.

    Once the migration is complete, you will not have access to the user associated with the username
    {{ old_username }}. Please take the following week to prepare for this transition.

    Thanks,<br />
