    We have scheduled a migration to be run on {{ scheduled_date }} that will impact your CommCare user. Your organization has requested that your user, {{ old_username }}, be migrated to a new user with the username {{ new_username }}.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following data will be copied to your new user:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>General user data (name, phone number, email, etc.)</li>
    <li>Project space memberships (including roles and locations)</li>
    <li>Saved reports</li>
    <li>Scheduled reports</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The following data will not be copied to your new user:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>API keys</li>
    <li>Pending CommCare invitations</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Additionally, your password will be reset for your new user, and two factor authentication (2FA) will be disabled by default.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the migration is complete, you will not have access to the user associated with the username {{ old_username }}. Please take the following week to prepare for this transition, and reach out to us if you have any questions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks,<br />
    CommCareHQ
