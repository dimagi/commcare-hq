    As mentioned a week ago, your CommCare user {{ old_username }} has now been migrated to the new user:
    {{ new_username }}.

    The following data was copied to your new user:
    <ul>
      <li>General user data (name, phone number, email, etc.)</li>
      <li>Project space memberships (including roles and locations)</li>
      <li>Saved reports</li>
      <li>Scheduled reports</li>
    </ul>

    The following data was not copied to your new user:
    <ul>
      <li>API keys</li>
      <li>Pending CommCare invitations</li>
    </ul>

    The {{ old_username }} user is no longer active. You can log into your new user with the username
    {{ new_username }}. If you are exempt from SSO, you can follow the <i>Forgot Password</i> workflow to successfully
    login.

    Thanks,<br />
