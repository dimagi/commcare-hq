    As mentioned a week ago, your CommCare user {{ old_username }} has now been migrated to the new user:
    {{ new_username }}.

    The following data was copied to your new user:
     - general user data (name, phone number, email, etc)
     - project space memberships (including roles and locations)
     - saved/scheduled report ownership

    The following data was not copied to your new user:
     - API keys
     - pending CommCare invitations

    The {{ old_username }} user is no longer active. You can log into your new user with the username
    {{ new_username }}. If you are exempt from SSO, you can follow the Forgot Password workflow to successfully login.

    Thanks,<br />
