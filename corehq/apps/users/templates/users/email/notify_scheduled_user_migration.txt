We have scheduled a migration to be run on {{ scheduled_date }} that will impact your CommCare user. Your
organization has requested that your user, {{ old_username }}, be migrated to a new user with the username
{{ new_username }}.

The following data will be copied to your new user:
 - General user data (name, phone number, email, etc.)
 - Project space memberships (including roles and locations)
 - Saved reports
 - Scheduled reports

The following data will not be copied to your new user:
 - API keys
 - Pending CommCare invitations

Additionally, your password will be reset for your new user, and 2FA will be disabled by default. If you are exempt
from SSO, you will be able to follow the Forgot Password workflow to log in.

Once the migration is complete, you will not have access to the user associated with the username
{{ old_username }}. Please take the following week to prepare for this transition.


Thanks,
CommCareHQ
