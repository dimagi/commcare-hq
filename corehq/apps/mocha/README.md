Mocha Tests
===========

## Adding a new app to test

There are three steps to adding a new app to test:

  1. Add the app name to the `Gruntfile.js` file. Note: the app has to correspond to an actual Django app.
  2. Create a mocha template in `corehq/apps/<app>/templates/<app>/spec/mocha.html` to run tests. See an example on [here](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/app_manager/templates/app_manager/spec/mocha.html).
  3. Create tests that are included in the template in `corehq/apps/<app>/static/<app>/spec/`


## Creating an alternative configuration for an app

Occasionally there's a need to use a different mocha template to run tests for the same app. An example of this is if the app uses javascript that depends on bootstrap2 libraries and javascript that depends on bootstrap3 libraries. In order to create multiple configurations, specify the app in the `Gruntfile.js` like this:

```
<app>#<config>  // (e.g. app_manager#b3)
```

Now mocha will look for that template in `corehq/apps/<app>/templates/<app>/spec/<config>/mocha.html`

The url to visit that test suite is `http://localhost:8000/mocha/<app>/<config>`
