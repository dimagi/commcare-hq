     * It serves as a test to see that Webpack is working fine with this type of module
     * and is an example of what a quick migration of an existing requirejs module might
     * look like.
     *
     * The most important difference between a requirejs module and a webpack module of this type
     * is that the webpack module requires that the "commcarehq" dependency is included
     * in the list of dependencies above. Otherwise, everything else should function
     * identically to the requirejs module, provided the appropriate shims are in place
     * in the Webpack config for special dependencies.
     *
     * For details on creating new shims, see: https://webpack.js.org/loaders/exports-loader/
     *
     * This file can be used to test such shims, webpack optimizations, or to carry out
     * preliminary Webpack-related tests in production environments.
