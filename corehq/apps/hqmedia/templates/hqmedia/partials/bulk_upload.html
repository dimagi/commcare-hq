    <p>
      Use this tool to upload ZIP files of your multimedia.
      The bulk uploader will compare the file paths in your form with the file paths
      in your zip to find a matching file.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, <code>jr://file/commcare/images/hin/image.jpg</code> and your zip's
      <code>commcare/images/hin/image.jpg</code> file would match, but it would <strong>not</strong> match
      <code>commcare/images/image.jpg</code>.
