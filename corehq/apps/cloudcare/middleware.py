        Set the formplayer_session cookie for sticky routing

        This is what makes all requests from a given user go to the same formplayer machine,
        along with https://git.io/JeDjr in commcare-cloud.

        For years previously, we routed based on the django sessionid, but that was brittle
        and the log out / log in cycle broke sticky routing because it changes the sessionid.
        Sticky routing with a high degree of consistency is essential to providing consistent
        phone-like state, and cracks in sticky routing lead to cases not being present in the
        formplayer local db when they should be and unintuitve behavior.
