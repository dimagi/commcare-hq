        Your CommCare subscription for {{ domain }} will be downgraded <b><i>after tomorrow</i></b> because your CommCare Billing Statements are more than 60 days overdue. If you do not make a payment before tomorrow, you will automatically be subscribed to the CommCare Community plan and lose access to all pay-only features and direct email support!
