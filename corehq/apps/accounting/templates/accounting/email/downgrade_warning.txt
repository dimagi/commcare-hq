Dear {{ domain }} administrator,

Your CommCare subscription for {{ domain }} will be downgraded after tomorrow because your CommCare Billing Statements are more than 60 days overdue. If you do not make a payment before tomorrow, you will automatically be subscribed to the CommCare Community plan and lose access to all pay-only features and direct email support!

To see the full list of unpaid invoices you can follow this link: {{ statements_url }}
As a reminder, payments can be made via credit card, Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT), or check by following the instructions at https://confluence.dimagi.com/display/commcarepublic/How+to+Pay+by+Credit+Card+or+Wire+Payment
You can also pre-pay for several months at any time by following the steps at https://confluence.dimagi.com/display/commcarepublic/CommCare+Pricing+FAQs#CommCarePricingFAQs-Pre-payment.
