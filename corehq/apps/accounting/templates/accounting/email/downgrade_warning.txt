Dear {{ domain_or_account }} administrator,

Your CommCare {{ subscriptions_to_downgrade }} will be paused after tomorrow because your CommCare Billing Statements are more than {{ days_overdue }} days overdue.
If you do not make a payment before tomorrow, your subscription will automatically be paused and you will lose access to your project space and data until you re-subscribe to a paid plan.

To see the full list of unpaid invoices you can follow this link: {{ statements_url }}
As a reminder, payments can be made via credit card, Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT), or check by following the instructions at https://dimagi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/commcarepublic/pages/2143956507/Payment+Methods+Instructions
You can also pre-pay for several months at any time by following the steps at https://dimagi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/commcarepublic/pages/2143950358/CommCare+Subscriptions+Pricing+FAQs#Monthly-Billing

If you have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact {{ contact_email }}. Thank you for using CommCare.

Best regards,
The CommCare HQ Team
