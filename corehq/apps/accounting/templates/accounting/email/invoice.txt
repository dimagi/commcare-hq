    To pay this bill, you can either choose a credit card or wire payment:
        - To pay by credit card, please go to your Billing Statements page, click
          on the green "Make Payment" button in front of your unpaid invoice(s),
          and fill in the amount you want to pay as well as your credit card
          details.
        - To pay by wire, find Dimagi's bank account details on your invoice.
          Please include the invoice number in your wire payment and make sure to
          send an email to {{ accounts_email }} after you have made the payment,
          mentioning the date of the payment, the amount, the invoice number, and
          the project space.
