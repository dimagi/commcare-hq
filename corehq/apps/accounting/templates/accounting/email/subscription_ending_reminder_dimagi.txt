Dear {{ dimagi_contact }}

You have been identified as the dimagi point of contact for the project space {{ domain }}.


This project has a subscription that is ending on {{ end_date }}. After that date, the subscription will automatically pause and this space will lose access to all features until it is re-subscribed to a new paid plan.


If you haven't already, can you follow up with the partner to confirm they are aware of this? If relevant, you can use the subscription with an upcoming end date email template to follow up.


Please note that the partner’s contacts ({{ contacts }}) will also receive a reminder on {{ client_reminder_email_date }} (30 days before their subscription end date, 30 days from today).


If you have any questions on this, please reach out to accounts@dimagi.com
