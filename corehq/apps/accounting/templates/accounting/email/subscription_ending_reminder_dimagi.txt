Dear {{ dimagi_contact }}

You have been identified as the dimagi point of contact for {{ account_or_domain }}.

{% if is_customer_account %}
  This account has a {{ plan }} subscription that is ending on {{ end_date }}.
{% else %}
  This project space has a {{ plan }} subscription that is ending on {{ end_date }}.
{% endif %}
After that date, the subscription will automatically pause and this space will
lose access to all features until it is re-subscribed to a new paid plan.


If you haven't already, can you follow up with the partner to confirm they are
aware of this? If relevant, you can use the subscription with an upcoming end
date email template to follow up.


Please note that the partnerâ€™s contacts ({{ contacts }})
will also receive a reminder on {{ client_reminder_email_date }}
(30 days before their subscription end date, 30 days from today).


If you have any questions on this, please reach out to {{ accounts_email }}.
