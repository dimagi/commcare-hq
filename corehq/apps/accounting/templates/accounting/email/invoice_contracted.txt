Hello Dimagi Team member,

You are listed as the Dimagi Contact related to the Billing Account *{{ billing_account }}* for project space {{ domain }} (on the The CommCare Plan Edition) subscription, and we need your help determining how these charges should be handled. This project is currently set to type Implementation, which means we have an existing services contract that is funding the product subscription.

In the past month, this account has incurred a total of $USD {{amount_due}} additional charges above what was already budgeted for in their current services contract. These charges are typically related to additional SMS or users that are not included in the pre-paid software plan nor in any pre-paid user or SMS credits that would have been included in the contract and added as credits as part of the initial set-up for the subscription.

Next Steps: Please review the attached detailed invoice, and to confirm one of the next steps outlined below:
- These charges are real, and should be passed on to the client via GS
- These charges are real, and should be passed on to the client via accounts@
- These charges are NOT real, or the charges are real but should be waived (if the users are test and can be deactivated or the customer should be on a higher plan level with more users included, etc)


Please email your your PM, project backstop, and CC {{ accounts_email }} once youâ€™ve determined the appropriate next steps.

Thanks,
Accounts
