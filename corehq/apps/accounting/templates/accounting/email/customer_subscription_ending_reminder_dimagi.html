  Dear {{ dimagi_contact }}
</p>
<p>
  You have been identified as the dimagi point of contact for {{ account }}.
</p>
<p>
  This account has a {{ plan }} subscription that is ending on {{ end_date }}. After that date, the subscription will automatically downgrade to the Free edition.
</p>
<p>
  If you haven't already, can you follow up with the partner to confirm they are aware of this? If relevant, you can use the subscription with an upcoming end date email <a href="https://dimagi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/saas/pages/2146603514/CommCare+Subscriptions+-+Account+Support+-+Email+templates">template</a> to follow up.
</p>
<p>
  Please note that the partnerâ€™s contacts ({{ contacts }}) will also receive a reminder on {{ client_reminder_email_date }} (30 days before their subscription end date, 30 days from today).
</p>
<p>
  If you have any questions on this, please reach out to {{ accounts_email }}.
