    Hello,
</p>

<p>
    This is a notice to inform you that your credit card payment for your CommCare
    subscription for project space:
    <a href="{{ domain_url }}">{{ domain }}</a>
    was declined. Please check to see
    if your billing information correctly matches your credit card.
</p>

<p>
    Here are the details of your declined payment:
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Billed To: {{ autopay_card.brand }} card with the last four digits {{ autopay_card.last4 }} expiring {{ autopay_card.exp_month }}/{{ autopay_card.exp_year }}</li>
        <li>Subscription plan: {{ subscription_plan }}</li>
        <li>Billing date: {{ billing_date }}</li>
        <li>Invoice #: {{ invoice_number }}</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Please update your billing information at
    <a href="{{ billing_info_url }}">{{ billing_info_url }}</a>
    to prevent disruption to your CommCare
    subscription. You'll need to pay the prior invoice whose payment method was
    declined, but future invoices will be paid via the updated billing
    information.
</p>

<p>
    If you have any questions, please contact {{ support_email }}.
</p>

<p>
    Thanks,
    <br/>
