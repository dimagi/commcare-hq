  Hello,
</p>

<p>
  This is a notice to inform you that your credit card payment for your CommCare
  subscription for project space:
  <a href="{{ domain_url }}">{{ domain }}</a>
  was declined. Please check to see
  if your billing information correctly matches your credit card.
</p>

<p>
  Here are the details of your declined payment:
  <br/>
<ul>
  <li>Billed To: {{ autopay_card.brand }} card with the last four digits {{ autopay_card.last4 }} expiring {{ autopay_card.exp_month }}/{{ autopay_card.exp_year }}</li>
  <li>Subscription plan: {{ subscription_plan }}</li>
  <li>Billing date: {{ billing_date }}</li>
  <li>Invoice #: {{ invoice_number }}</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  Please update your billing information at
  <a href="{{ billing_info_url }}">{{ billing_info_url }}</a>
  to prevent disruption to your CommCare
  subscription. You'll need to pay the prior invoice whose payment method was
  declined, but future invoices will be paid via the updated billing
  information.
</p>

<p>
  If you have any questions, please contact {{ support_email }}.
</p>

<p>
  Thanks,
  <br/>
