<p>Dear Finance team,</p>

<p>
The {{ plan_name }} plan subscription for project space {{ domain }} (attached to Billing account <strong>{{billing_account}}</strong> {% if salesforce_contract_id %} and Salesforce ID <strong>{{salesforce_contract_id}}</strong>){% endif %}), set as Contracted, has incurred a total of ${{amount_due}} additional charges in the past months. Those charges are linked to additional SMS or user charges that are not included in the Pre-paid software plan nor in any pre-paid additional SMS/Credits that would have been included in the contract and added as credits at the initial set-up of that subscription. You can find attached the detailed invoice.
</p>

The billing contacts for this Billing Account are:
<ul>
{% for billing_contact in billing_contacts %}
<li><a href="mailto:{{billing_contact}}">{{billing_contact}}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>
    The finance team is responsible for deciding when and how to communicate these additional charges/this invoice to the partner.
</p>
