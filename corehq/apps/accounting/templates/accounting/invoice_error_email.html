<p>Dear Dimagi Billing People,</p>

<p>
    The project <strong>{{ project }}</strong> experienced the following issue
    while I was generating invoices today:
</p>

<p>
    {{ error_msg }}
</p>

<p>
    I didn't log this as an error directly to the devs because it looks like
    it requires some human-human TLC, which I hear y'all are pretty good at and
    I totally suck at this. Please help me out here, as I'm just a little bot.
</p>

<p>
    Thanks a bunch,<br />
