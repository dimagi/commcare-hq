      You will lose access to your project space, but you will be able to
      re-subscribe any time in the future.

      You will no longer be billed. However, based on your payment method
      you may have an open invoice for the service provided this month.

  <li>
    {% blocktrans %}
      Autopay enrollment will be canceled. At the end of the billing period you
      will receive a final invoice for any unbilled usage. We will attempt to
      automatically pay this invoice on its due date.

      Re-subscribing will restore full access to your project space, including
