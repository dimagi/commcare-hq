Dear {{ dimagi_contact }}

You have been identified as the dimagi point of contact for the project space {{ domain }}.



This project has a subscription that is ending on {{ end_date }}. After that date, the subscription will automatically downgrade to the Community Plan.


If you haven't already, can you follow up with the partner to confirm they are aware of this? If relevant, you can use the subscription with an upcoming end date email template to follow up.


Please note that the partnerâ€™s contacts ({{ contacts }}) will also receive a reminder 30 days before their subscription end date (10 days from now).


If you have any questions on this, please reach out to accounts@dimagi.com
