Dear {{ dimagi_contact }}
</p>
<p>
You have been identified as the dimagi point of contact for the project space {{ domain }}.
</p>

<p>
This project has a subscription that is ending on {{ end_date }}. After that date, the subscription will automatically downgrade to the Community Plan.
</p>
<p>
If you haven't already, can you follow up with the partner to confirm they are aware of this? If relevant, you can use the subscription with an upcoming end date email <a href="https://confluence.dimagi.com/display/commcarehq/CommCare+HQ+Billing+-+Email+Templates#CommCareHQBilling-EmailTemplates-SubscriptionEnding">template</a> to follow up.
</p>
<p>
Please note that the partnerâ€™s contacts ({{ contacts }}) will also receive a reminder 30 days before their subscription end date (10 days from now).
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions on this, please reach out to <a href="mailto:accounts@dimagi.com">accounts@dimagi.com</a>
