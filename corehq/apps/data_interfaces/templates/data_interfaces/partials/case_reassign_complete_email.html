<p>Hello,</p>

  {% trans "The bulk case reassignment has completed successfully." %}

<p>
  {% blocktrans with case_count=result.case_count report_url=result.report_url %}
  Succesfully reassigned {{ case_count }} cases.
  <p>The list of cases that were reassigned can be viewed at <a href='{{ report_url }}'>{{ report_url }}</a>.</p>
  <p>
  It's possible that in the report the owner_id is not yet updated, you can open individual cases and confirm
  the right case owner, the report gets updated with a slight delay.
