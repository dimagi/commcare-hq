            Since you've opted to publish your multimedia along with your app,
            you must select a license that is more restrictive than the multimedia in the app.
        </p>
        <p>
            To satisfy this condition, you can either decide not to publish the multimedia
            or select one of the following licenses:
        </p>
        <ul>
        {% for license in licenses %}
            {{ license }}
        {% endfor %}
        </ul>
