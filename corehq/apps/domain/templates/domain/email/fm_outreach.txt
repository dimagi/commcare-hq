Hey,

I noticed that your project space {{ domain_name }} has had a lot of submissions.
I'm emailing you because you are a web user on the project with a Dimagi email
address, and I'm really curious what kind of project I'm hosting. 

If this is a test project space, go to the project settings page {{ settings_link }} and
change the "test project" setting to "test" and I'll stop bothering you.

If this project space does represent a new real project, let me know by updating
a few of my settings as described on the wiki:  
https://confluence.dimagi.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=18908393.

Thanks for all you do!

Love,
CommCareHQ
