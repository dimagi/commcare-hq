Hi There! My name is Robin, and I run the support team at Dimagi. I work with {{ contact_name }} and look forward to helping you use CommCare successfully.

Going forward, we have many ways to support you:

* Community Support - We welcome you to sign up at commcare-users google group [1] to stay up to date about CommCare updates. You may pose questions here to our global community of CommCare users.

* Reporting Technical Issues - Once we've agreed that an issue is a bug, please report them using our Report a Problem button at the bottom of your project space on CommCareHQ. Guidelines for How to Report a Bug can be found here: Bug Report Template [2].

* CommCare Helpsite - You will find more resources available at help.commcarehq.org. [3]

Let me and {{ contact_name }} know if you have any questions!

Thanks,

Robin
