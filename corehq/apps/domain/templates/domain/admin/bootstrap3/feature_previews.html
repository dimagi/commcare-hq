          Before we invest in making certain product features generally
          available, we release them as Feature Previews to learn the
          following two things from usage data and qualitative feedback.

              <strong>Perceived Value:</strong>
              The biggest risk in product development is to
              build something that offers little value to our users. As such,
              we make Feature Previews generally available only if they have
              high perceived value.

              <strong>User Experience:</strong>
              Even if a feature has high perceived value,
              it is important that the user experience of the feature is
              optimized such that our users actually receive the value.
              As such, we make high value Feature Previews generally
              available after we optimize the user experience.

          Feature Previews are in active product development, therefore
