Changes Feed Application
------------------------

This app provides a [kafka-based](http://manage.dimagi.com/default.asp?185853) implementation of a changes feed.
This will allow for creating an abstraction layer between CouchDB and Pillows so that when we move models off of couch, we will be able to seamlessly port the pillows over.

__This is still an experimental prototype.__

# Dependencies

These pillows are dependent on Kafka, which is dependent on Zookeeper.
It should not (yet) be necessary to run these services in a typical developer setup, but if you need to, Kafka provides a [quickstart guide](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#quickstart) to getting up and running quickly.
For a more robust setup/installation you can use Ansible to setup Zookeeper and Kafka on your dev environment, or in a VM.
This can be accomplished using the following script (assuming you have an appropriate ansible environment configured):

```
ansible-playbook -i inventories/development -e '@vars/dev.yml' deploy_stack.yml --tags=kafka
```

# Configuration

If you use the default configuration you should not have to do anything.
If you are running kafka in a VM, on another machine, or on a nonstandard port, you will need to override `KAFKA_URL` in your `localsettings.py`.
