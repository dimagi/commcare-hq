# Data Registry
A Data Registry is a concept that allows sharing of case data between multiple project spaces.

A Data Registry can be created by one project space and other project spaces can be invited
to *join* or *participate* in the registry.

Once a project space has accepted the invitation they are able to *grant* other project spaces
access to their data. They are also able to use the registry to access the data from other
project spaces which has been *granted* to them.
