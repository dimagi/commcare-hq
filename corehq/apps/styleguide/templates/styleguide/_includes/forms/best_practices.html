            All forms for a Django App should be either in a <code>forms.py</code>

        </li>
        <li>
            Form class names should always end with Form.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your imports should generally look like:

from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy, ugettext as _
from crispy_forms.helper import FormHelper
from crispy_forms import layout as crispy
from crispy_forms import bootstrap as twbscrispy
from corehq.apps.style import crispy as hqcrispy</code></pre>
