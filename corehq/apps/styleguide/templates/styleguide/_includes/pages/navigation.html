  <h2>Standard navigation</h2>
  <p>
    These navigation elements should be present on almost every page.
    The following assumes that the page descends from <a
    href='https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/hqwebapp/templates/hqwebapp/bootstrap3/base_section.html'
    target='_blank'>hqwebapp/bootstrap3/base_section.html</a>, which virtually all pages should.
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>Top navigation</dt>
      <dd>
        The top navigation should <strong>always</strong> be visible to users.
        Individual tabs are defined in
        <a href='https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/tabs/tabclasses.py'
           target='_blank'>tabclasses.py</a>. Which tab is highlighted depends on the
        <code>url_prefix_formats</code> defined for each tab. Which items appear in a tab's dropdown is
        determined by <code>dropdown_items</code>.
      </dd>
      <dt>Side navigation</dt>
      <dd>
  <p>
    The side navigation appears almost everywhere. Major exceptions are the dashboard, which has no
    navigation, and app manager, which has a custom sidebar corresponding to the app's structure. Other
    pages should almost certainly have a sidebar.
  </p>
  <p>
    The sidebar is also defined in <a
    href='https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/tabs/tabclasses.py'
    target='_blank'>tabclasses.py</a>, controlled by the <code>sidebar_items</code> functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Temporary sub-items that appear only when on a specific page, such as the "Create Form Data
    Export" item that appears under the main "Export Form Data" item only when you're creating a
    new export, can be added using the <code>subpages</code> property.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dynamic item names, such as displaying the username when editing a web user, can be enabled by
    passing a function to the menu item's <code>title</code>.
  </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Breadcrumbs</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Breadcrumbs are defined by the <code>parent_pages</code> in the template context (see below for how
      to populate). Standard pages should have a breadcrumb for the top nav section (e.g., "Data"), for
      the left sidebar section if there is one (e.g., "Edit Data"), and for the page itself.
      Multi-step workflows such as case import should also be reflected in breadcrumbs.
      All items in the breadcrumbs should be links, except for the last (the current page).
    </p>
    <p>
      A few pages override the <code>page_breadcrumbs</code> block defined in
      <a href='https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/hqwebapp/templates/hqwebapp/bootstrap3/base_section.html'
         target='_blank'>hqwebapp/bootstrap3/base_section.html</a>. This should only be done in exceptional
      circumstances.
    </p>
  </dd>
  </dl>
  </p>

  <h2>Page headers</h2>
  <p>
    A page header at the top of the page's main content helps the user stay oriented, and this is
    a good place to briefly introduce the user to the page and link to documentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is an area where the technical implementation isn't well-standardized.
    When possible, set <code>page_title</code> in the template's context.
    Some pages do create the header by hand.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/example_html.html' with slug='nav-header' title='Page header' content=examples.header %}

  <h2>In-page navigation</h2>
  <p>
    If a page has multiple sections, you have a few options to visually separate them:
  <ul>
    <li>Split into multiple pages.</li>
    <li>
      Enclose each section in a <a
      href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#panels' target='_blank'>panel</a>.
      Note that app manager has its own panel styling, <code>.panel-appmanager</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Set each section up as a <a
      href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#nav-tabs' target='_blank'>tab</a>.
      Avoid using <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#nav-pills'
                     target='_blank'>pills</a> for navigation, because they look similar to the
      <a href='{% url 'styleguide_molecules' %}#molecules-selections'>toggles</a> used in
      forms.
    </li>
  </ul>
