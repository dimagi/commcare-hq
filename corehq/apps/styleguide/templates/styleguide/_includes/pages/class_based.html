  <p class="lead">
    Ultimately all views are based on django's <code>TemplateView</code> class,
    if the view has a user-facing UI.
  </p>
  <p>
    If not, then inheriting from a simple
    <code>View</code> will probably be enough.
  </p>

  <h2>The <code>BaseDomainView</code></h2>
  <p>
    If your view has something to do with the <code>domain</code>, then
    it will probably inherit from this view.
  </p>
  <p>
    What benefits do you have from using this view?
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The permission <code>login_and_domain_required</code> is already in effect established.</li>
    <li>
      <code>self.domain</code> (the name of the domain) is already available as an instance variable for your class and is
      automatically inserted into the template's context.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>self.domain_object</code> is already available as an instance variable (the <code>Domain</code>
      instance with the domain name given by <code>self.domain</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <code>self.page_url</code> property is already avaiable, provided that your page doesn't
      require other args beyond <code>domain</code>. If it does (for instance if your url looks like
      <code>/a/[domain]/my/page/[unique-id]</code>, then you'll have to re-implement
      <code>self.page_url</code> with the required arguments.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Here is an example of a class inheriting from the <code>BaseDomainView</code>.
  </p>
  <pre>class MyView(BaseDomainView):
    urlname = 'my_view'</pre>
  <p>
    (Required) <code>urlname</code> will be the string referenced when you do the url mapping for
    this view in it's application's <code>urls.py</code>.<br />(e.g.
    <code>url(r'^myview/$', MyView.as_view(), name=MyView.urlname)</code>.
  </p>
  <pre>   template_name = 'all_the_views/my_view.html'
    page_title = gettext_lazy("My View")
    section_title = gettext_lazy("All the Views")

    @property
    def section_url(self):
        return reverse(MySectionPageRoot.urlnale, args=[self.domain])</pre>
  <p>
    (Required) <code>section_title</code> and <code>section_url</code> are the title and url
    for the "tab" or major content area that the view is inside. For instance, Settings,
    Users, Data, Reports, etc. (See
    <a href="#creating-base-section">Creating a Base View for my Section</a> for best
    practices on abstracting this out so that every View in the same Section doesn't have to
    define this each time).
  </p>

  <p>
    Both the <code>section_url</code> and <code>page_title</code> are used in rendering
    the page's breadcrumbs (it's the first crumb).
  </p>

  <pre>    @property
    def parent_pages(self):
        return [
            {
                'title': MyParentPageView.page_title,
                'url': reverse(MyParentPageView.urlname, args=[self.domain]),
            }
        ]</pre>

  <p>
    (Optional) This is what shows up as the hierarchy in the Breadcrumbs for the page, and is
    what's in between the first crumb (the section) and the last crumb (the current page).
  </p>

  <pre>    @property
    def page_name(self):
        return "{domain}'s {page_title}".format(
            domain=self.domain,
            page_title=self.page_title,
        )</pre>
  <p>
    (Optional) <code>page_name</code> by default returns <code>page_title</code>. It's a
    way of adding request-specific context to the <code>page_title</code>, but still having
    access to the <code>page_title</code> from a class level for general referencing of the page.
  </p>
  <pre>    @property
    def page_context(self):
        return {
            'form': MyForm(),
        }</pre>
  <p>
    (Optional) While <code>page_context</code> is optional, it's very likely you'll implement it,
    as that's where you return all the variables specific to that page. If you are starting to create
    a hierarchy where you're then adding to the <code>page_context</code> via.
  </p>
  <pre>    # note, this is an example of what NOT to do
    @property
    def page_context(self):
        context = super(MyView, self).page_context
        context.update({
            'form': MyForm(),
        })
        return context</pre>
  <p>
    Then, first, ask why you need that specific hierarchy. Perhaps you want to just inherit from
    a Base Section view? Second, this should never happen with <code>page_context</code>. That's what
    <code>main_context</code> is for, as that covers the context for more than one page (or in the
    next example, a whole section).
  </p>
  <h2 id="creating-base-section">Creating a Base View for My Section</h2>
  <p>
    The best practice is to create a Base Section View for all of the views
    that will be part of that section (or tab) so that <code>section_title</code>
    <code>section_url</code> and any section-specific context can be added to the
    <code>main_context</code>.
  </p>
  <pre>class BaseMySectionView(BaseDomainView):
    section_name = "My Section"

    @property
    def section_url(self):
        return reverse(TheRootOfMySection.urlname, args=[self.domain]

    @property
    def main_context(self):
        context = super(BaseMySectionView, self).main_context
        context.update({
            'my_section_emoji': "bears",
        })
        return context</pre>
  <p>
    <code>main_context</code> here is optional but a good place to insert any section-specific
    template contexts in.
  </p>

  <pre>
    def dispatch(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return super(MyView, self).dispatch(request, *args, **kwargs)</pre>
</section>
