        Colors serve to emphasize information and contribute to a more organic
        looking interface. The world is colorful place, so why shouldn't our
        software appear just as lively?

        Keep in mind that <strong>emotional reactions to colors can vary geographically</strong>.
        For instance, red in Africa might mean something completely different
        from red in India. For this reason, it is important to use caution when
        choosing what function a color has in the interface, and expect the most
        negative reaction.

        An additional point of consideration is that not everyone sees color the
        same way. Many people are affected by various types of <strong>color blindness</strong>.
        It is important to make sure that colors are <em>never</em> the source
        of critical information. Also, when colors are used to compare information
        (legend of a bar or line chart) it is important that the colors used
        can be differentiated by people with each type of color blindness.
