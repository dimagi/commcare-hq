    We strive to establish recognizable patterns to guide users through the UI.
    CommCare uses similar palettes on both the mobile and server side.

    When combining colors, use light text on a dark or medium background
    and dark text on a light background. We make use of Bootstrap 5's
    <code>$min-contrast-ratio</code> setting at a value of
    3 to automatically determine when to show dark or light text on a background when using
    the <code>text-bg-<$color></code> class on an element.

    As described in <a href="{% url 'styleguide_atoms_accessibility_b5' %}">Accessibility</a>,
    many people are affected by various types of <strong>color blindness</strong>.
    It is important to make sure that colors are <em>never</em> the source
    of critical information. Also, when colors are used to compare information
    (legend of a bar or line chart) it is important that the colors used
    can be differentiated by people with each type of color blindness, and when color separation is
    not easily possible, distinguishable patterns are used in their place.
