    Colors for Communication
  </h2>
  <p>
    We strive to establish recognizable patterns to guide users through the UI.
    CommCare uses similar palettes on both the mobile and server side.
  </p>
  <p>
    When combining colors, use light text on a dark or medium background
    and dark text on a light background. We make use of Bootstrap 5's
    <code>$min-contrast-ratio</code> setting at a value of
    3 to automatically determine when to show dark or light text on a background when using
    the <code>text-bg-<$color></code> class on an element.
  </p>
  <p>
    As described in <a href="{% url 'styleguide_atoms_accessibility_b5' %}">Accessibility</a>,
    many people are affected by various types of <strong>color blindness</strong>.
    It is important to make sure that colors are <em>never</em> the source
    of critical information. Also, when colors are used to compare information
    (legend of a bar or line chart) it is important that the colors used
    can be differentiated by people with each type of color blindness, and when color separation is
    not easily possible, distinguishable patterns are used in their place.

    Note: The subtle shades provided are present so that hex values of "subtle" colors are easily accessible
    for design purposes. These lighter subtle colors are intended to be coupled with
    darker text on top and are used as default backgrounds for Molecules like Alerts.

    Colors for Design
  </h2>
  <p>
    Sometimes there is a need for additional colors when designing a new component which don't fall into any
    of the communication categories above. The simple requirement is a color that meets our branding requirements.
    For this we have several theme colors accessible through <code>SCSS</code> variables that follow
    the Dimagi brand guidelines and Bootstrap 5 shading rules.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    <strong>Important:</strong> These colors should not be applied to HQ without sign-off from senior developers
    and a design review. The colors appear here for reference of what options are available for use.
  </div>

  <h3 id="color-design-blue" class="pt-4">
    CommCare Blue aka Blue
  </h3>
  <p>
    The CommCare "cornflower blue" is what's applied to the <code>$primary</code>, and therefore <code>$blue</code>
    or <code>$blue-500</code> shade. Below are approved gradations from light to dark based on this color.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/atoms/partials/gradient.html' with gradient=gradient.blue %}

  <h3 id="color-design-gray" class="pt-4">
    Gray
  </h3>
  <p>
    While <code>$dark</code>, <code>$secondary</code>, and <code>$light</code> are the preferred shades
    of gray for the theme, it is also possible to choose additional shades listed below.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/atoms/partials/gradient.html' with gradient=gradient.gray %}

  <h3 id="color-dimagi-gradient" class="pt-4">
    Dimagi Gradient
  </h3>
  <p>
    Dimagi's branding has a gradient of color going from <code>$dimagi-indigo</code> (aka <code>$indigo</code>)
    to <code>$dimagi-mango</code> (aka <code>$orange</code>).
    We sliced this gradient into 25% intervals due to a decent contrast ratio of colors between intervals.
    However, since <code>$orange</code> often has an emotional conection between danger and warning, we leave that
    out of the usable "design" colors, preferring to include shades from <code>$indigo</code> to <code>$salmon</code>.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/atoms/partials/gradient.html' with gradient=gradient.slices %}

  <h4 id="color-dimagi-gradient-shades" class="pt-4">
    Gradient Shades
  </h4>
  <p>
    Below are the above four design-friendly gradient colors divided further into Bootstrap 5 interval shades,
    where the <code>$*-500</code> color is equivalent to the main color listed above.

  <h3 id="dimagi-colors" class="pt-4">
    Dimagi Palette
  </h3>
  <p>
    Below are the six colors named in the Dimagi color palette. The ones in use by our theme are marked.
    However, since <code>$dimagi-deep-purple</code> feels very similar to <code>$indigo-800</code> and
    <code>$dimagi-sky</code> similar to <code>$blue-400</code>, we prefer to avoid use of those colors.
