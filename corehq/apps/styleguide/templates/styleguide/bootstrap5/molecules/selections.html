  <h2 id="overview">
    Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
    A good rule of thumb when deciding what selection component to use is the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Select-Toggles</strong> are good for selecting between a small list of items (2-5 items).</li>
    <li><strong>Select2s</strong> are good for selective from a very large set of items, as it supports pagination.</li>
    <li><strong>Multiselects</strong> are useful when the action involves moving items between two lists.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For any user-defined data, it's difficult to be certain how many items will be in the list. Even data sets
    that we might expect to be small&mdash;such as the number of forms in a module&mdash;might be large for
    certain projects. It's better to assume that a list will grow large and display it as some kind of dropdown
    where the options are a click away, rather than to assume it'll stay small and display all options on the page.
  </p>
  <h2 id="select-toggle" class="pt-4">
    Select-Toggle
  </h2>
  <p>
    On the occasions when a list is guaranteed to be short (2-5 items), consider displaying it as a toggle.
    This shows all options and only takes one click to select.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use a custom toggle widget <code>&lt;select-toggle&gt;</code> that uses
    <a href="https://knockoutjs.com/documentation/component-overview.html" target="_blank">Knockout Components</a>
    and is conceptually the same as a single-select dropdown.
    See
    <a href="https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/hqwebapp/static/hqwebapp/js/components/select_toggle.js" target="_blank">select_toggle.js</a>
    for full documentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    There's also a <code>SelectToggle</code> widget for use with Forms, defined in
    <a href="https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/ab80b0017c12eb7fddb54bb20b2a186b07e8294f/corehq/apps/hqwebapp/widgets.py#L140-L160" target="_blank">hqwebapp's widgets.py</a>.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_example.html' with content=examples.toggles %}
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    A few places in HQ use the same look and feel as the select toggle widget but have unique implementations.
    They generally use bootstrap's
    <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/button-group/' target='_blank'>button groups</a> and
    also often include our own <code>btn-group-separated</code> class,
    which separates the buttons, making them easier to read and wrap better.
  </div>

  <h2 id="select2" class="pt-4">
    Select2
  </h2>
  <p>
    For most lists, select2 is the way to go. It adds behavior to a normal <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element.
    It supports either hard-coded static options or dynamic options fetched via ajax. It can support free text
    options, acting like an autocomplete, or can restrict users to a specific list of options.
    Beyond these major options, select2 supports many more specific features and styling options; see
    the <a href='https://select2.org/' target='_blank'>full documentation</a> for details.
  </p>
  <p>
    We instantiate select2 in a number of different ways: manually with javascript, via knockout bindings,
    and by using CSS classes that certain javascript modules search for.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also have a <code>select2</code> options for common behaviors like validating email addresses and displaying form
    questions. Before you add a new custom set of <code>select2</code> options, please look around and ask
    around for other parts of HQ that have similar behavior.
  </p>
  <h3 id="select2-manual" class="pt-3">
    Manually in Javascript
  </h3>
  <p>
    This is the most straightforward way of initializing a <code>select2</code> element.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_example.html' with content=examples.select2_manual %}
  <h3 id="select2-css-class" class="pt-3">
    Referencing a CSS Class
  </h3>
  <p>
    We can automatically initialize a <code>select2</code> using the css class <code>hqwebapp-select2</code>,
    as long as the <code>hqwebapp/js/widgets</code> module is present.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_example.html' with content=examples.select2_css_class %}
  <p>
    This also applies <code>&lt;select multiple&gt;</code> elements:
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_example.html' with content=examples.select2_css_class_multiple %}
  <h3 id="select2-ko-dynamic" class="pt-3">
    Dynamic Knockout Binding
  </h3>
  <p>
    We can also use the knockout binding <code>select2</code> to initialize a <code>select2</code>, with options
    provided by Knockout.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_example.html' with content=examples.select2_ko_dynamic %}
  <h3 id="select2-ko-static" class="pt-3">
    Static Knockout Binding
  </h3>
  <p>
    We can also initialize a <code>select2</code> with the <code>staticSelect2</code> Knockout Binding, where the options
    are pulled from <code>HTML</code> instead of Knockout. This is useful for <code>select2s</code> that have
    non-varying options but don't work with the <code>hqwebapp-select2</code> CSS class because they're inside a
    Knockout-controlled UI, so they aren't guaranteed to exist on page render.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_example.html' with content=examples.select2_ko_static %}
  <h3 id="select2-ko-autocomplete" class="pt-3">
    Autocomplete Knockout Binding
  </h3>
  <p>
    To initialize a <code>select2</code> to autocomplete select suggestions, use the <code>autocompleteSelect2</code>
    Knockout binding.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_example.html' with content=examples.select2_ko_autocomplete %}

  <h2 id="multiselect" class="pt-4">
    Multiselect
  </h2>
  <p>
    This is a custom widget we built. It can be useful in situations where the user is adding and removing
    items from one list to another and wants to be able to see both the included and excluded items.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    <strong>Be cautious adding it to new pages!</strong> Be sure that the visual
    weight and potential learning curve is worthwhile for the workflow
    you're creating. It's more complicated than a dropdown and takes up much more space.
  </div>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_example.html' with content=examples.multiselect %}
  <h4 id="multiselect-optional-properties" class="pt-3">
    Optional Properties
  </h4>
  <p>
    In addition to the optional title properties, the following properties can be useful in situations where more
    control is needed.
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dd>
      <strong>disableModifyAllActions</strong>&mdash;defaults to <code>false</code>, useful when the preferred
      workflow is to disable the ability to select and remove all items at once.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      <strong>willSelectAllListener</strong>&mdash;provides an opportunity to execute code prior to all items being
      selected
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h2 id="other-selection" class="pt-4">
    Other Selection Interactions
  </h2>
  <p>
    There are several other interactions used on HQ to select items from a list, however use of these options
    should be <strong>limited</strong> compared to the options above.
  </p>
  <h3 id="other-standard-select" class="pt-3">
    Standard Select Elements
  </h3>
  <p>
    There's nothing inherently wrong with standard <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements, but since so many
    dropdowns use <code>select2</code>, <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements without this styling create
    visual inconsistency. It should typically be trivial to turn a standard <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>
    element into a <code>select2</code>.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    <strong>Long Lists:</strong> Standard <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements do interfere with usability
    when their list of options gets long.
    For instance, with 15+ items, it becomes difficult to find and select an item. Therefore, long lists
    in particular should be switched to <code>select2</code>.
  </div>
  <h3 id="other-checkbox-lists" class="pt-3">
    Lists of Checkboxes
  </h3>
  <p>
    Like standard HTML select elements, there's nothing inherently wrong with these, but because
    we don't use them often, they're bad for a consistent user experience.
  </p>
  <h3 id="other-atjs" class="pt-3">
    At.js
  </h3>
  <p>
    At.js is a library for mentioning people in comments. It's the basis for <strong>easy references</strong> in
    Form Builder, used in the xpath expression builder. Form builder also uses it for autocomplete behavior
    (form builder doesn't have <code>select2</code> available).
  </p>
  <p>
    Case List Explorer use At.js for creating the advanced search query by allowing the user to search
    and reference case properties as they build a query.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both Form Builder and Case List Explorer use At.js in a powerful way: to build queries or expressions with advanced
    syntax. At.js <strong>should not</strong> be used for simple autocomplete or select behavior.
  </p>
