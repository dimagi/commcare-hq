  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>
    When adding a table, first consider the nature the information you're displaying. Tables
    are best suited to tabular data, so if that's not what you're working with,
    consider other design options.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    Tabular data is data that is organized in a table with rows and columns&mdash;like Excel or GSheets.
    There are generally several columns with headings and several rows of repeating data related to those headings.
  </div>
  <p>
    To increase "scannability" it's best to observe the following guidelines:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Follow common table setups described below to ensure functionality is always familiar to users.
    </li>
    <li>
      Avoid extremely wide tables that stretch beyond visible page boundaries or are full-page
      widths with few columns.
    </li>
    <li>
      Align headings with data in columns.
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep small screens in mind, consider
      <a href="https://css-tricks.com/rotated-table-column-headers/"
         target="_blank">oblique headers</a>
      (headers at a 45-degree angle).
    </li>
    <li>
      In languages that read left to right, left-align text and right-align numbers.

    Most of our tables use hand-crafted markup based on Bootstrap's styles. Some areas of CommCare,
    particularly reporting, use
    <a href="https://datatables.net/manual/" target="_blank">DataTables</a> and are tightly integrated
    with the python code that generates the data.

    Tables and Layout?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Due to the nature of table cells and the ability to stack them horizontally, vertically, and apply certain
    alignment rules to their contents, it can be very appealing to use tables to for layout.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Please do not do this.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    As mentioned in the first sentence of the overview, tables are for <strong>tabular data</strong>. They are
    <strong>not</strong> for aligning form fields or creating page sections and layouts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are pointers toward more optimal decisions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Need to create vertical "columns" of sections within a page?
        Bootstrap 5's <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/" target="_blank">Grid</a> and
        <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/columns/" target="_blank">Column</a> guides can help.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Tempted to use a table with form labels and fields? Please don't. We have great documentation on how to
        <a href="{% url "styleguide_organisms_forms_b5" %}#html-forms">horizontally style forms properly</a>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        "What if my data doesn't fit the grid system? Tables seem so much more flexible for things like vertical alignment
        and dynamic widths." If this sounds familiar, then perhaps Bootstrap 5's
        <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/flex/" target="_blank">flex utilities</a> are what you need.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="basic-table" class="pt-4">
    Basic Table
  </h2>
  <p>
    Below is an example of a very basic table without any pagination or reporting style.
    Using a basic table is appropriate when you know the data displayed by this table will remain fairly short
    (no more than 25 items). As it gets longer than that, please consider using pagination.
  </p>
  <p>
    Important: If the data displayed by a table is fully user controlled or generated with no strict limits,
    expect that the data will scale and eventually that table will become unusable to a certain subset of users.
  </p>
  <p>
    To control column spacing, use the <code>.col-(xs|sm|mg|lg)-[0-9]</code> classes provided by
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/" target="_blank">
      Bootstrap 5's grid system
    </a>.

    Sectioned Table
  </h2>
  <p>
    It's often the case that multiple tables might exist on a page. If that is the case, consider
    using the "sectioned table" styling below.

  <h2 id="datatables" class="pt-4">
    Report Tables (Datatables)
  </h2>
  <p>
    Reports with advanced filters on HQ, such as the ones found in the "Reports" section, all use a javascript
    library called <a href="https://datatables.net/manual/" target="_blank">DataTables</a> to display the data.
    DataTables is an extensive library with built-in support for pagination, column sorting, data typing, and more
    (especially when you consider the ecosystem of datatables extensions).
  </p>
  <p>
    In CommCare HQ, we have created a wrapper class around our reporting use of datatables called
    <code>GenericTabularReport</code>, which takes care of generating the datatables configuration in
    <code>config.dataTables.bootstrap.js</code>. This was done in an effort to reduce the amount of HTML and
    javascript required to create a report, as generating custom reports for projects was once very common in HQ.
    With the introduction of User Configurable Reports (UCRs), this need for quickly creating these hard-coded
    custom reports has since been eliminated.
  </p>
  <p>
    As of the time of this writing, the current reporting infrastructure could use a re-examination. It is one of the
    oldest un-refactored parts of HQ and, therefore, contains a lot of design problems. It's best to examine this
    area of the codebase with a great deal of scrutiny. As the styleguide is aimed at explaining the visual side of HQ,
    we recommend that you visit our
    <a href="https://commcare-hq.readthedocs.io/reporting.html" target="_blank">Read the Docs on Reporting</a> to get
    a better idea of the back end implementation.
  </p>
  <p>
    When our reporting tools were created, DataTables was still a fairly young library and had its own set of issues,
    which you can see in <code>config.dataTables.bootstrap.js</code> if you examine the strangely named variables in
    still in "hungarian notation" style. Thankfully, the developers of dataTables have kept later versions
    backwards-compatible with this older notation, but for reference here is a
    <a href="https://datatables.net/upgrade/1.10-convert" target="_blank">conversion guide</a> for the older configuration
    parameters and what the modern equivalents are.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    {# todo future developer: remove with use_bootstrap5 removal cleanup and revisit text above too #}
    <strong>Important:</strong> As of the time of this writing, the Bootstrap 3 to 5 migration is still ongoing
    and the Reporting section has not yet been migrated. Please ensure that during that migration, the notation in
    <code>config.dataTables.bootstrap.js</code> is updated. Thank you.
  </div>
  <h3 id="datatables-simple" class="pt-3">
    Simple Example
  </h3>
  <p>
    Below is an example of a standalone datatable. This kind of datatable does not really exist on HQ outside a
    report or UCR view, as discussed above. It's mainly here as a simplified demonstration to connect the styling
    and javascript
  </p>
  <p>
    This example fetches the data asynchronously to avoid
    having to hardcode the tabular data, however it does not do any server-side processing or pagination.
    Please see the documentation for
    <a href="https://datatables.net/examples/data_sources/server_side" target="_blank">Server-Side Processing</a>
    with DataTables if you want to understand how to do this further.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, the example below makes use of one extension called <code>FixedColumns</code>, which is used across
    a few reports in HQ. This supports fixing at least one column to the left or right of the report, allowing the rest
    of the tabular data to scroll underneath it when scrolling horizontally.
  </p>
  <p>
    Stylistically, the tables with report-style advanced filters and column sorting all use the visual style
    described below. Tabular data that exists outside this framework of advanced filters and column sorting use
    the standard  Bootstrap table styles. Tables that require pagination but do not have advanced
    filtering capabilities of the Report views should use the Paginated Table style.
  </p>

  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    <strong>Important Usage Note:</strong> To use Datatables on a page, you will need to apply the
    <code>@use_datatables</code> decorator to your view to ensure that the CSS (on all views) and javascript
    (on non-requirejs views) are included.
    If you are using requirejs, make sure that <code>datatables.bootstrap</code> is in your list of dependencies.
    If you are using the <code>fixedColumns</code> extension, make sure that <code>datatables.fixedColumns.bootstrap</code>
    is in your list of dependencies.

  <h2 id="paginated-table" class="pt-4">
    Paginated Table
  </h2>
  <p>
    Below is an example of a paginated table. As explained in the <a href="{% url "styleguide_molecules_pagination_b5" %}">Pagination</a> section of
    this guide, it is best to review how this pagination of tabular data is actually used in HQ. The Pagination guide
    has a few notable examples mentions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the example below makes use of the same fake data source as the Datatables example above for
    stylistic demonstration only. When this component is actually used in HQ, the data that exists in the table's
    rows is most likely not reporting data. Most of the time, these paginated tables contain more complex objects that
    have additional primary and secondary actions associated with them and more complex interactions. The
    Web users and Mobile Workers pages showcase this component well.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, these paginated tables generally have a simple search functionality for filtering the data and often
    no support for column sorting. If you find yourself requiring advanced filtering and column sorting,
    perhaps you want to build a report. In that case, please see the datatables section above as well as our
    docs on <a href="https://commcare-hq.readthedocs.io/reporting.html" target="_blank">Reporting</a>.
