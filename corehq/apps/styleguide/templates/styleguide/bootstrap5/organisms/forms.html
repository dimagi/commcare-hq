  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Forms in HQ are a mix of bespoke HTML and
    <a href="http://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.org/en/latest/" target="_blank">Crispy Forms</a>.
    Different parts of HQ use these two approaches, and you should always consider existing context
    when deciding whether to use Crispy Forms or HTML.
  </p>
  <p>
    The benefit of Crispy Forms, and why you should opt for using it over bespoke HTML whenever possible,
    is that the HTML for each form component is controlled by templates. From HTML is often affected
    during a front-end migration (like Bootstrap). If a bespoke HTML form was used, that HTML needs
    to be re-examined everywhere.
    However, for forms using Crispy Forms, the relevant HTML only has to be changed once in the templates,
    which makes the overall migration faster and easier.
  </p>

  <h2 id="crispy-forms" class="pt-4">
    Crispy Forms
  </h2>
  <p>
    <a href="http://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.org/en/latest/" target="_blank">Crispy Forms</a>
    generates HTML for forms based on form layouts defined in python. Use of this library contributes to consistency
    in design and reduces boilerplate HTML writing. It also helps reduce HTML changes required during a front-end
    migration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Crispy Forms does not control the form's logic, processing, validation, or anything having to do with form data.
    It is used to specify the layout and hooks for the display logic, for instance a <code>data-bind</code>
    for Knockout. Django Forms still controls the remaining data-processing.
  </p>

  <h3 id="crispy-forms-simple" class="pt-3">
    A Simple Example
  </h3>
  <p>
    Below is a very simple crispy forms example. The point where Crispy Forms becomes a part of the form is when
    <code>self.helper</code> is set. The layout of the form is then defined in
    <code>self.helper.layout</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To include this form in a template, <code>{% verbatim %}{% load crispy_forms_tags %}{% endverbatim %}</code>
    must be included at the top of the template, and <code>{% verbatim %}{% crispy form %}{% endverbatim %}</code>
    should be placed where the form should appear
    &mdash; the variable <code>form</code> (or other variable name) is set in the template context.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some additional notes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        It's best practice to set <code>self.helper</code> to either <code>HQFormHelper</code> or <code>HQModalFormHelper</code>,
        both defined in <code>hqwebapp.crispy</code>. These helpers help standardize the <code>label_class</code> and
        <code>field_class</code> css classes, as well as the <code>form_class</code> css class.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <code>self.helper.form_action</code> is where you can set the url for the form to post to.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="crispy-forms-knockout" class="pt-3">
    Using Knockout with Crispy Forms
  </h3>
  <p>
    The example below demonstrates various ways Knockout Bindings can be applied within a Crispy Form. Please review the
    comments in python code for further details.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/form_js_example.html' with content=examples.crispy_knockout %}

  <h2 id="html-forms" class="pt-4">
    HTML Forms
  </h2>
  <p>
    HQ uses styles provided by <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/forms/overview/" target="_blank">Bootstrap 5 Forms</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notes on the example below:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Forms need to include a <code>{% verbatim %}{% csrf_token %}{% endverbatim %}</code> tag to protect against <a
        href='https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)' target='_blank'>CSRF
        attacks</a>. HQ will reject forms that do not contain this token.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The sets of grid classes (<code>col-sm-*</code>, etc.) can be replaced by
        {% verbatim %}<code>{% css_field_class %}</code>, <code>{% css_label_class %}</code>, and
        <code>{% css_action_class %}</code>{% endverbatim %}, which will fill in HQ's standard form
        proportions. See comments in the HTML example below if usage isn't clear.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The dropdown here (and throughout this section) should use a select2, as discussed in
        <a href='{% url 'styleguide_molecules_selections_b5' %}#select2' target='_blank'>Molecules > Selections</a>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The textarea uses the <code>vertical-resize</code> CSS class to allow for long input.
        Inputs that accept XPath expressions are especially likely to have very long input.
        The text area does not support horizontal resizing, which can allow the user to expand a
        textarea so that it overlaps with other elements or otherwise disrupts the page's layout.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The <code>autocomplete="off"</code> attribute on the inputs controls the browser's form autofill.
        Most forms in HQ are unique to HQ and should always turn off autocomplete to prevent unexpected
        automatic input. Exceptions would be forms that include information like a user's name and address.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        This example does not show translations, but all user-facing text should be translated.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="validation" class="pt-4">
    Form Validation
  </h2>
  <p>
    Good error messages are specific, actionable, visually near the affected input. They occur as soon as a
    problem is detected. They help the user figure out how to address the situation: "Sorry, this isn't
    supported. Try XXX." Without any cues, the user is stuck in the same frustrating situation.
  </p>

  <h3 id="field-errors" class="pt-3">
    Showing Field Errors
  </h3>
  <p>
    Errors in forms should be displayed near the relevant field / input using the <code>is-invalid</code> class
    directly on the errored <code>form-control</code> or <code>form-select</code>. The corresponding feedback
    message can be provided beneath the relevant field inside of a <code>&lt;span class="invalid-feedback"&gt;</code>
    element. This element should come before the <code>form-text</code> (help text) element.
    See the example below, as well as
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/forms/validation/" target="_blank">Bootstrap5's Validation</a> docs
    for more options.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_example.html' with content=examples.form_invalid %}

  <h3 id="form-errors" class="pt-3">
    Showing Form Errors
  </h3>
  <p>
    Sometimes we encounter a situation where a general error was encountered when creating a form that can't be
    pinpointed to a specific field. In this case, we should use the Django Messages framework to raise an error from
    the view to the page. This might look something like:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light my-3">
    <div class="card-body ">
      <pre class="m-0">messages.error(request, gettext("This is an error"))</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    In javascript,
    <a href="https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/hqwebapp/static/hqwebapp/js/bootstrap5/alert_user.js"
       target="_blank">alert_user.js</a> provides the same functionality.
  </p>

  <h3 id="cirspy-errors" class="pt-3">
    Showing Errors in Crispy Forms
  </h3>
  <p>
    Crispy Forms automatically adds the <code>is-invalid</code> and <code>valid-feedback</code> markup when a field
    throws a <code>ValidationError</code> when calling <code>is_valid()</code> on the attached Django Form. The
    example below shows how we can throw a field-level error.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can also throw form-level <code>ValidationError</code>s in the main  <code>clean()</code> method of the form.
    However, it is preferred that we use the Django Messages framework (as explained above) for raising
    these general errors.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/form_example.html' with content=examples.crispy_errors %}

  <h3 id="valid-fields" class="pt-3">
    Marking Fields as Valid
  </h3>
  <p>
    Valid fields be displayed near the relevant field / input using the <code>is-valid</code> class
    directly on the valid <code>form-control</code> or <code>form-select</code>. The corresponding feedback
    message can be provided beneath the relevant field inside of a <code>&lt;span class="valid-feedback"&gt;</code>
    element. This element should come before the <code>form-text</code> (help text) element.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_example.html' with content=examples.form_valid %}

  <h3 id="valid-crispy" class="pt-3">
    Valid Feedback in Crispy Forms
  </h3>
  <p>
    At the moment, Django Forms doesn't propagate valid feedback up to the form, so Crispy
    Forms has no way to display this information automatically. In the real world, marking fields as
    valid will likely come from client-side validation with Knockout Validation.
  </p>

  <h3 id="ko-validation" class="pt-3">
    Knockout Validation
  </h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/Knockout-Contrib/Knockout-Validation" target="_blank">Knockout Validation</a>
    is an extension of Knockout that we use to do client-side validation of form fields.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have several custom validators that can be used as well as the built-in ones that
    ship with Knockout Validation:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/hqwebapp/static/hqwebapp/js/bootstrap5/validators.ko.js"
           target="_blank">validators.ko.js</a> contains several custom validators. Use of these validators is
        demonstrated in the example below.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/hqwebapp/static/hqwebapp/js/password_validators.ko.js"
           target="_blank">password_validators.ko.js</a> contains validators related to password checks.
        <code>minimumPasswordLength</code> is demonstrated below, but <code>zxcvbnPassword</code> needs to
        be used inside an AMD module setup.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The example below makes use of most of our custom knockout validators (in various states) as well as
    some built-in validators to demonstrate how we might use Knockout Validation to do client-side validation
    on a user creation form. Please review the comments in the source code for additional guidance.
