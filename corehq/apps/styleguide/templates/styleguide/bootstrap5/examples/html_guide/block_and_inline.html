<div class="row mt-4">
  <h1>Short titles: one line ok</h1>
  <h2>
    However, longer titles (like a sentence) should be indented.
  </h2>
  <p>
    This is paragraph text within a block element. It should always follow
    standard indentation nested within its parent element. If you have a
    <a href="https://dimagi.com">link</a> within the paragraph, that's fine to
    leave inline with text, as well as <code>code</code> tags or
    <span data-somedata="foo">span</span> tags, etc.
    <a
      class="btn-link"
      href="http://dimagi.com" target="_blank"
    >Long links</a>, even though they are inline elements, can also behave more
    like block elements within the paragraph, to reduce the overall line
    length of that text.
  </p>
  <p>
    Short paragraph text should also be on its own line within a <code>p</code> parent.
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktrans %}
      Translated text within a paragraph tag should always be indented like this
    {% endblocktrans %}
  </p>
  <h3>
    {% trans "Short titles are fine" %}
  </h3>
  <p>
    If you have <img alt="{% trans "Translated text within attributes" %}">, then use
    <code>trans</code> instead of <code>blocktrans</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    And if you have lists....
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        The Indentation structure should look like this.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
