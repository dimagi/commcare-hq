  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>
    In Django there are two approaches to creating a view: class-based views and functional views.
  </p>
  <p>
    Class-based views (CBV) are the most commonly chosen view for rendering a user-facing UIs on HQ.
    This is due to the ease of setting up the template context in the view inheritance, as well as the application of
    permissions-related decorators that cover an entire section or subclass of pages.
    Very rarely are class-based views chosen for returning data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Functional views are used mainly for data views (for instance returning a <code>JsonResponse</code>),
    POSTing data, or as redirect views. Sometimes functional views are used to render templates,
    but this is not very common on CommCare HQ and is not recommended unless the use case requires it.
  </p>
  <h2 id="templates" class="pt-4">
    Templates
  </h2>
  <p>
    Regardless of whether a view is class-based or functional, if the view returns a template it <strong>must</strong>
    extend one of the two types of templates below.
  </p>
  <h3 id="templates-centered-page" class="pt-3">
    Centered Page
  </h3>
  <p>
    A <a href="{% url "example_centered_page_b5" %}">Centered Page</a> is generally a very simple single-page UI.
    This is usually reserved for login and registration, error pages, or a user's list of projects. These are one-off
    pages that don't fit into a collection of views or navigational area.
  </p>
  <p>
    All templates that form a centered page extend the <code>hqwebapp/bootstrap5/base_page.html</code> template,
    or extends a template that eventually extends the <code>base_page.html</code> template.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_display.html' with content=examples.simple_centered_page %}
  <h3 id="templates-section-page" class="pt-3">
    Section (Two-Column) Page
  </h3>
  <p>
    A <a href="{% url "example_section_b5" %}">Section Page</a> is a page that has left-hand side navigation
    and breadcrumbs. There is an overall "section" that ties all the pages shown in the left-hand navigation together.
    Examples are Reports and Project Settings sections of a project space.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_display.html' with content=examples.simple_section %}
  <h3 id="template-context" class="pt-3">
    Template Context
  </h3>
  <p>
    The template context is a dictionary passed to the template that defines all the variables the template needs
    to render that page. In class-based views, there is a lot of guidance
    built into the CBV structure that ensures no important pieces of the template context are missed.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you see views where the breadcrumbs are partially rendered or the page header looks a bit different
    from the other pages, it's likely that view did not have its template context properly set up.
  </p>
  <p>
    With functional views, it is very easy to return a poorly formatted template context that causes the resulting
    page to look a bit strange. The developer might be tempted to override <code>page_header</code> or navigation
    blocks from the extending templates. Please do not rush to do this! First, explore whether the template context is
    missing any information. We've created some helper methods <code>corehq.apps.hqwebapp.context</code> to help
    structure the template context if you are working with a functional view. This usage is shown in the functional
    view examples below.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    It's always recommended that you use a class-based view to render a template,
    unless you have a very good reason for using a functional view.
  </div>

  <h2 id="class-based-views" class="pt-4">
    Class-Based Views
  </h2>
  <p>
    In comparison with functional views, class-based views help keep the UI standardized. As you will see in the
    examples below, the template context is conveniently taken care of by the class structure. This template context
    helps make sure that all the necessary pieces of information are provided to render breadcrumbs, navigation,
    page titles, and <code>title</code> tags properly in the <code>base_page.html</code> and
    <code>base_section.html</code> templates.
  </p>

  <p>
    Below is an example of a
    <a href="{% url "example_centered_page_b5" %}">centered page</a> and a
    <a href="{% url "example_section_b5" %}">section page</a>. The templates are covered in the Templates section above.
  </p>

  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_display.html' with content=examples.class_view %}

  <p>
    We won't dive into great detail about the implementation here, as there is a lot of information about
    <a href="https://commcare-hq.readthedocs.io/class_views.html#a-basic-centered-page"
       target="_blank">using Class-based views on CommCare HQ</a> in our Read-the-docs.
  </p>
  <p>
    This page serves as a quick reference and a way to see
    a working example. It's also a good place to start to inspect any front end changes to templates in the event
    of another Bootstrap upgrade.
  </p>

  <h2 id="functional-views" class="pt-4">
    Functional Views
  </h2>
  <p>
    Below are several examples of functional views. The views rendering templates make use of the context helper
    <code>get_page_context</code> found in <code>corehq.apps.hqwebapp.context</code> to help structure the template
    context needed to correctly render templates extending the <code>base_page.html</code> and
    <code>base_section.html</code> templates.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also see working examples of a
    <a href="{% url "example_centered_page_functional_b5" %}">Function-Based Centered Page</a> and a
    <a href="{% url "example_section_functional_b5" %}">Function-Based Section Page</a>.
  </p>

    Mapping Urls to Views

  <p>
    Below is an example of how the class-based and functional-view examples above are specified in a
    <code>urlpattern</code>.
