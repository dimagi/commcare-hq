    Overview
  </h2>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    At present, HQ is undergoing a migration from Bootstrap 3 to Bootstrap 5. At the end of this migration, please
    update this notice and leave this page as documentation for the next Bootstrap migration.
  </div>
  <p>
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> is a third-party UI library used throughout
    HQ. It's essentially a set of stylesheets and javascript widgets. This means that migrating from one version to the
    next involves the following kinds of work:

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Styling updates</strong>: This can be as simple as replacing a renamed CSS class, which is often handled
            automatically by our migration tool. It can also mean updating HQ stylesheets to work harmoniously with
            Bootstrap's new/updated styles.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>HTML updates</strong>: Some of the new/updated Bootstrap styles correspond to HTML changes. This affects simple
            widgets like dropdown menus, which may now need classes to be applied differently - for
            example, the children of dropdown menus now need to use a new <code>dropdown-item</code> class.
            Our migration tool detects widgets that need to be updated, although a developer is needed to implement
            the changes. The tool can automatically make other HTML-related changes, such as renaming attributes
            like <code>data-toggle</code> that have been renamed in the new version.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>JavaScript updates</strong>: HQ uses a number of Bootstrap-provided interactive widgets, such as modal dialogs.
            The APIs for accessing these widgets have changed, so the calling code needs to be updated.
            There are also a few non-Bootstrap widgets that depend on a specific version of Bootstrap and need to
            be migrated to a new version.
            Our migration tool detects usage of widgets that need to be updated, but a developer is needed to make the
            changes.
        </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Because the HQ codebase is large, we are taking an incremental approach to this migration.
    For organizational purposes, we are executing and tracking this migration primarily on an app-by-app basis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Multiple versions of Bootstrap cannot coexist on the same page.
    The <code>@use_bootstrap5</code> decorator marks individual views as migrated to Bootstrap 5. This decorator
    sets a <code>use_bootstrap5</code> attribute on the request that's used to set up the
    relevant Bootstrap environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    This means that files that are required by both migrated and unmigrated pages need to be "split" into two
    versions: one to include on Bootstrap 3 pages and another to include on Bootstrap 5 pages. This applies largely to code that
    is fundamental to HQ's UI and used throughout the platform, such as the <code>hqwebapp</code> app, the
    analytics JavaScript libraries, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    It can also be helpful to "split" files in this way while migrating an app. This allows
    Bootstrap 5 changes to be developed, reviewed, and merged in small pieces, before switching the Bootstrap
    version used in production. It is a more complex process that adds more code during the migration,
    although most of this code is automatically generated by the migration tool.
    In these cases, once the app is fully migrated, the Bootstrap 3 files can be deleted.
  </p>
  <p>
    To support this approach, we have tooling that facilitates "splitting" and "unsplitting" files:
    copying files, moving them, and updating references to them. This tooling also performs the simpler migration
    updates, such as renaming CSS classes. For updates that it cannot handle automatically, it adds a TODO comment
    to the relevant code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the entire platform is fully migrated to Bootstrap 5, any remaining Bootstrap 3 code can be removed:
    the Bootstrap 3 versions of files in <code>hqwebapp</code> and similar apps, the <code>@use_bootstrap5</code>
    decorator, any code related to <code>request.use_bootstrap5</code> or <code>window.USE_BOOTSTRAP_5</code>,
    the Bootstrap 3 stylesheets and JavaScript library, and so forth.
  </p>

  <h2 id="prepare-local-environment" class="pt-4">
    Step 0: Prepare Local Environment
  </h2>
  <p>
    If you haven't done so, you will need to install Dart Sass to compile
    <code>scss</code> files. The recommended method is with homebrew <code>brew install sass/sass/sass</code>,
    as described in <code>DEV_SETUP.md</code>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="announce-migration" class="pt-3">
    Step 1: Announce Migration
  </h2>
  <p>
    <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tkSXR643Da-fp6a-uYPa5dYs5if4W2LqtvUJs3IfUKs/edit#gid=0"
       target="_blank">This spreadsheet</a></strong> is a high-level tracker of which apps have been migrated.
    It contains notes on the approximate size of different apps (in terms of how many views they contain) and on
    inter-app dependencies.
  </p>
  <p>
    The migration tool supports two general workflows for migrating an app: one based on splitting all files into
    Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 5 versions, and one based on migrating files "in place." The splitting files approach
    is <strong>necessary</strong> for apps that are dependencies for other apps, which will need to support both
    Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 5 for a while. It is <strong>optional</strong> for small, independent apps.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before you begin the migration of an app, please announce your intention to do so in <code>#gtd-dev</code>.
    It is helpful to be aware of other front-end development in the app. If the app has ongoing front-end
    development, consider delaying either that development or the migration, to reduce code conflicts.
    After announcing your intent to migrate the app, please update
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tkSXR643Da-fp6a-uYPa5dYs5if4W2LqtvUJs3IfUKs/edit#gid=0"
    target="_blank">the app's migration status</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="no-split" class="pt-3">
    Step 2 (small apps): The "No Split" Process
  </h2>
  <p>
    For small apps that are not depended on by other apps, the migration tool supports a streamlined process that
    does not require splitting files into a Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 5 version. This is a good option for apps
    with a small number of views, as it involves fewer pull requests and avoids the overhead of splitting files.
    This approach does the entire migration in a single pull request, which
    makes it unlikely to be a good choice for apps with 10+ views.
  </p>
  <p>
    To begin a "no split" migration, first
    <a href="http://localhost:8000/styleguide/b5/migration/#pre-work" target="_blank">lint</a> the app's JavaScript
    and make a pull request for any linting changes. Then, to begin the actual migration, run:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">./manage.py migrate_app_to_bootstrap5 &lt;app_name&gt; --no-split</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    This will iterate through all the templates and javascript files in <code>&lt;app_name&gt;</code>,
    applying all automated fixes and adding TODO comments for fixes that aren't automated. After
    staging the changes to each file, you will have the option to auto-commit those changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    For each migrated template, the command will wait for you to apply the <code>@use_bootstrap5</code> decorator
    to the relevant views (see <a href="#migrating-views">Migrating Views</a>) before moving on to the next template.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once all the files are migrated in-place, go through the TODO comments, which reference helper documents in the
    <a href="https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/tree/master/corehq/apps/hqwebapp/utils/bootstrap/changes_guide"
    target="_blank">changes_guide</a> directory.
  </p>
  <p>
    After all TODOs are addressed, test your work: load the page and
    test out any interactivity. Most migrations should also go through QA. Migrations can skip QA if they make
    relatively superficial changes and are in low-risk areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also mark the migration as "complete" as part of your pull request. This updates a status file where we
    programmatically track the status of the overall platform migration. To do so:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">./manage.py complete_bootstrap5_migration &lt;app_name&gt;</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    You're done! Ignore the rest of this document.
  </p>

  <h2 id="split-files" class="pt-4">
    Step 2 (large apps): Auto-Migrate &amp; Split Files
  </h2>
  <p>
    For large migrations, the first step is to split affected template and javascript files into <code>bootstrap3</code> and
    <code>bootstrap5</code> versions. This is an automated process that uses a management command to find and
    replace the straightforward changes, while flagging more complex changes to be addressed later.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the migration changes are staged, the file and split into the two bootstrap versions, with the
    migration changes saved to the <code>bootstrap5</code> version. The two files are then saved to separate
    <code>bootstrap3</code> and <code>bootstrap5</code> directories under the original parent directory.
  </p>
  <p>
    The command will then find references to the original filepath and replace them with the filepath to the
    <code>bootstrap3</code> version.
  </p>
  <h3 id="pre-work" class="pt-3">
    Pre-Work: Lint JavaScript
  </h3>
  <p>
    Pre-work: Your life will be easier if you lint the app's JavaScript <em>before</em> the migration script
    duplicates every js file. This is usually not arduous. To find lint errors, make sure you have
    <a href="https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started#quick-start">eslint installed locally</a> and then
    run:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">npx eslint corehq/apps/&lt;app_name&gt;</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    If you can, please cherry-pick these lint commits into a separate PR and merge those changes before creating
    the PR to split the files.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    <strong>Important:</strong> Avoid including lint fixes and split-files changes in the SAME commit.
    These changes MUST be separated.
  </div>

  <h3 id="large-apps" class="pt-3">
    Step 2.1A: Migrating Large Apps
  </h3>
  <p>
    Please set aside focused time to PR these changes as soon as possible to avoid any migration conflicts or
    missed renamed references, especially in parts of the codebase that are undergoing frequent front-end changes. This
    initial "split file" Pull Request should <strong>only</strong> contain changes automatically made by the management command.
    Additional changes should be made in subsequent PRs.
    <a href="https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/pull/34345" target="_blank">Here is an example Pull Request</a> of this step.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use the management command below with <code>&lt;app_name&gt;</code> being the
    name of the application you would like to migrate:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">./manage.py migrate_app_to_bootstrap5 &lt;app_name&gt; --skip-all</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    For instance, if you want to migrate <code>corehq.apps.reminders</code>, you would use <code>reminders</code> as
    <code>&lt;app_name&gt;</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The option <code>--skip-all</code> is optional, but recommended unless you have a particularly tricky app
    as it speeds up the migration process by auto-committing the split files changes for each template and
    javascript file in the app. If you use <code>--skip-all</code>, you are still responsible for changes made by
    the tool, so it's a good idea to review the auto-generated commits in GitHub or your favorite diff tool.
  </p>
  <p>
    If <code>--skip-all</code> is not used, the management command will iterate through all template and javascript
    files in the app. You have the option to review and accept each change line-by-line or review
    the diff for each file at the end.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regardless of what route you take, code will also be updated with TODO comments noting areas that need
    attention and could not automatically be updated.  These comments reference helper documents in the
    <a href="https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/tree/master/corehq/apps/hqwebapp/utils/bootstrap/changes_guide"
    target="_blank">changes_guide</a> directory.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    <p>
      If templates or javascript files have several nested dependencies, you may need to run this split files step
      multiple times.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, let's suppose one template called <code>webapps_base.html</code> is
      split into <code>bootstrap3</code> and <code>bootstrap5</code> versions. In that same run of
      <code>migrate_app_to_bootstrap5</code>, a template called <code>question.html</code> was already checked but
      never split because it did not contain code needing an upgrade. However, this template extends
      <code>webapps_base.html</code>, so it does need to be split.
    </p>
    <p>
      When <code>webapps_base.html</code> is renamed to a <code>bootstrap3</code> path, the <code>extend</code> path
      in <code>question.html</code> is also updated. Since <code>question.html</code> was checked before
      <code>webapps_base.html</code>, the migration script did not catch that <code>question.html</code> now extends from
      a <code>bootstrap3</code> template. A second run of <code>migrate_app_to_bootstrap5</code> would catch this and
      accurately split <code>question.html</code>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3 id="update-diffs" class="pt-3">
    Step 2.2: Configure &amp; Update Diffs
  </h3>
  <p>
    Since a large app migration usually takes several weeks, we need to ensure that any changes
    made to <code>bootstrap3</code> templates during this time are kept in sync with their <code>bootstrap5</code>
    counterparts. We do this by saving diffs of the split files and running tests against them to ensure diffs stay the
    same. Once changes are made to both split files, the diffs can be regenerated so that tests continue to pass.
  </p>
  <p>
    As <code>migrate_app_to_bootstrap5</code> iterates through each template and javascript directory,
    it will create new <code>bootstrap3</code> and <code>bootstrap5</code> directories.
    For instance <code>app_manager/base_template.html</code> now becomes
    <code>app_manager/bootstrap3/base_template.html</code> and <code>app_manager/bootstrap5/base_template.html</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    When new split directories are created, please ensure the paths to these directories are added to
    <a href="https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/hqwebapp/tests/data/bootstrap5_diff_config.json" target="_blank">
      bootstrap5_diff_config.json
    </a> and commit those changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    For most applications, you can just run the following command to automatically update <code>bootstrap5_diff_config.json</code>:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">./manage.py build_bootstrap5_diffs --update_app &lt;app_name&gt;</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Once those changes (if any) are committed, please run the following management command and commit the results:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">./manage.py build_bootstrap5_diffs</pre>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3 id="verify-references" class="pt-3">
    Step 2.3: Verify References
  </h3>
  <p>
    Right before submitting the "split files" Pull Request, it is important to rebase the latest <code>master</code>
    branch into your working branch and run the following command:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">./manage.py migrate_app_to_bootstrap5 &lt;app_name&gt; --verify-references</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    This will iterate through all the split <code>bootstrap3</code> files in the app and ensure that references to the
    old file (without <code>bootstrap3/</code> in the filepath) are updated to the <ocde>bootstrap3</ocde> path.
    The reason why we do this right before making the pull request is so that any changes merged into master since
    the split files process began are checked for references so that we can avoid any 404s or 500s.
  </p>
  <p>
    After verifying references, it might be necessary to run <code>build_bootstrap5_diffs</code> again before finally
    opening the Pull Request.
  </p>

  <h3 id="re-migrate" class="pt-3">
    Step 2.4: Re-Migrate Files
  </h3>
  <p>
    There is a chance that during the time your split-files PR was open, someone might have added a new template or
    javascript file, or made a change to one of the <code>bootstrap3</code> versions of an already split file.
    If you merge <code>master</code> into your split files branch and find that the diffs have diverged for a file,
    please run the following command to re-migrate the <code>bootstrap3</code> version of that file.
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">./manage.py migrate_app_to_bootstrap5 &lt;app_name&gt; --filename &lt;file_path&gt;</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    In this usage, <code>&lt;file_path&gt;</code> can either be the file name of the diverged file or the relative path.
    For example, if <code>builds/bootstrap3/edit_menu.html</code> diverged, you can specify <code>edit_menu.html</code>
    or <code>builds/bootstrap3/edit_menu.html</code> as the <code>&lt;file_path&gt;</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This command will then re-apply the migration changes to the <code>bootstrap3</code> file and then save those
    changes to the <code>bootstrap5</code> version. You can then commit those changes and then run
    <code>build_bootstrap5_diffs</code> to rebuild the diffs.
  </p>

  <h2 id="update-stylesheets" class="pt-4">
    Step 2B: Migrate Stylesheets
  </h2>
  <p>
    Some larger applications, like the App Builder and Web Apps, have their own stylesheets that add or modify styles
    on top of the main stylesheet. Since Bootstrap 5 has moved to using SASS / SCSS instead of LESS, <code>less</code>
    files that are part of the app undergoing a migration will need to be migrated from <code>less</code> to
    <code>scss</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The process for this step in the migration is not automated due to the rarity and complexity of this requirement.
    You can begin this process by creating parallel <code>scss</code> files for all the existing <code>less</code>
    files. The contents can be copied over from <code>less</code> to <code>scss</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The syntax will need to be updated to
    use SCSS style variables and mixins.
    <a href="https://www.martyfriedel.com/blog/moving-from-less-to-scss" target="_blank">Here is a guide</a> to
    help with those changes. Changes that are common in HQ code include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Variables and string interpolation
        <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
          <div class="card-body">
            <pre class="m-0">// LESS
@thing: 10px;
.@{my-prefix}-kind-of-text: 10px;
height: calc(~"100vh - 65px");

// SCSS
$thing: 10px;
.#{$my-prefix}-kind-of-text: 10px;
height: calc(100vh - 65px);  // tildes typically weren't necessary</pre>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        Mixins
        <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
          <div class="card-body">
            <pre class="m-0">// LESS
.my-mixin(@param1, @param2) { ... }
.my-mixin(170px, 115px);

// SCSS
@mixin my-mixin { ... }
@include my-mixin(170px, 115px);</pre>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        Removing bootstrap 3 browser support mixins, including <code>.transition</code>, <code>.box-shadow</code>, and border radius mixins.
        <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
          <div class="card-body">
            <pre class="m-0">// LESS
.box-shadow(0 0 10px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2));

// SCSS
box-shadow: 0 0 10px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);</pre>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        Updating responsive styling that depends on screen widths:
        <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
          <div class="card-body">
            <pre class="m-0">// LESS
@media(min-width: @screen-xs) { ... }
@media(max-width: $screen-sm-max) { ... }

// SCSS
@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-down(lg) { ... }</pre>
          </div>
        </div>
        Note that the screen size categories have changed from bootstrap 3 to 5, so see the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#responsive-utilities-classes">old docs</a>
        and the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/">new docs</a>, and test
        your changes. Also note that using the B5 mixins requires imports:
        <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
          <div class="card-body">
            <pre class="m-0">@import "mixins";
@import "functions";</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Updating imports. Look at how imports are done in other parts of HQ that use SCSS, such as
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/hqwebapp/static/hqwebapp/scss/commcarehq.scss">hqwebapp</a> and
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/hqwebapp/static/cloudcare/scss/formplayer-common-main.scss">cloudcare</a>.
        Imports may not be one-for-one replacements, since B3 and B5 are organized differently, and you may have dropped some B3 styles or added some B5 styles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remember to update the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> elements in HTML, including changing the <code>type</code>
        from <code>text/less</code> to <code>text/scss</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    It is important to update any variables from the old Bootstrap 3 stylesheet to their Bootstrap 5 counterparts.
    Please work closely with the lead developer of the Bootstrap migration, so you can receive guidance to do this
    part accurately.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    Updating stylesheets is in large part a mechanical process. As always, please commit large mechanical changes
    separately from changes that need closer review.
  </div>
  <p>
    You will have to update <code>bootstrap5_diff_config.json</code> manually when working with stylesheet files.
    To confirm which directories to add, check your app for directories with "bootstrap3" in the name:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">find corehq/apps/&lt;app_name&gt; -type d | grep bootstrap3</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    You can then see existing stylesheet file configuration in the config file as an example for how to update it
    for your stylesheets.
  </p>

  <h2 id="migrating-views" class="pt-4">
    Step 3: Migrating Views
  </h2>
  <p>
    The next step is to migrate the app's views one-by-one. It is recommended to make a pull request for each view
    or group of small related views, rather than migrating a lot of views and having a very large Pull Request.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    If the type of view you are migrating is a <strong>Report View</strong>, please jump to the
    <a href="#migrating-report-views">Migrating Report Views</a> section below.
  </div>
  <p>
    The migration process begins by either applying <code>@use_bootstrap5</code> decorator the view function or
    <code>@method_decorator(use_bootstrap5, name='dispatch')</code> to the view class. Also update the template's
    name in the view from <code>bootstrap3/foo.html</code> to <code>bootstrap5/foo.html</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The automation should have updated the view template so that it inherits from <code>bootstrap5</code>
    base templates. It should also have updated any <code>bootstrap3</code> javascript dependencies to their
    <code>bootstrap5</code> versions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The automation will have added comments to the template and javascript files noting what changes need to be
    made. Each comment will be marked with <code>todo B5</code> and the type of change that needs to be made.
    Each type of change has a corresponding document in the
    <a href="https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/tree/master/corehq/apps/hqwebapp/utils/bootstrap/changes_guide"
    target="_blank">changes_guide</a> directory explaining what needs to be done.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once a view's template and javascript files are updated, it is now time to load that view and test for
    any javascript or visual errors. The view should be as similar
    as possible to its Bootstrap 3 version, which you can compare with on production.
  </p>
  <p>
    A pixel-perfect migration from Bootstrap 3 to Bootstrap 5 will likely not be possible for each page, as Bootstrap 5
    has removed several components (like <code>panel</code>, for instance) and replaced them with new components
    (like <code>cards</code>). The migration helper <code>migrate_app_to_bootstrap5</code> should help with
    guidance for making more complex replacements of removed components.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    The most important part of the migration is ensuring that the page is functionally similar to the user and that no
    errors are present on the page that were not previously present in the Bootstrap 3 version.
  </div>

  <h3 id="un-split-view-files" class="pt-3">
    Un-Split View Files
  </h3>
  <p>
    Once your view is functional under the Bootstrap 5 changes, check to see whether the <code>boostrap3</code> versions
    of your template or javascript files are being referenced elsewhere. If not, it is time to "un-split" that template
    by removing the <code>bootstrap3</code> version of that file and moving the <code>bootstrap5</code> version into
    the file's original location before the split.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the file you are un-splitting is a template, run:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">./manage.py complete_bootstrap5_migration &lt;app_name&gt; --template &lt;filename&gt;</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    If the file you are un-splitting is a javascript file, run:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">./manage.py complete_bootstrap5_migration &lt;app_name&gt; --javascript &lt;filename&gt;</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Please follow the guidance of the <code>complete_bootstrap5_migration</code> management commands for suggested
    commit messages and when to commit changes.
  </p>

  <h3 id="migrating-report-views" class="pt-3">
    Migrating Report Views
  </h3>
  <p>
    If you are migrating a Report, you may realize there is no <code>dispatch</code> method to apply
    the <code>@use_bootstrap5</code> decorator to. That's because reports are rendered by a
    <code>ReportDispatcher</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Migrating a Report View will be different from other Views:
  </p>
  <h4 class="pt-2">
    1. Set the <code>use_bootstrap5</code> class variable to <code>True</code>
  </h4>
  <p>
    For example, if we want to
    migrate the <code>SubmitHistory</code> report, we would do the following:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">class SubmitHistory(...):
    ...
    use_bootstrap5 = True
    ...</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h4 class="pt-2">2. Use the report debugging tool</h4>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">class SubmitHistory(...):
    ...
    debug_bootstrap5 = True
    ...</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    You can then view the output in the console for tips on what templates and filters to migrate.
    <strong>Important: please don't commit this line at the end!</strong>
  </p>

  <h4 class="pt-2">3. Migrate report templates (if needed)</h4>
  <p>
    Check to see that your report doesn't have custom templates that override base report templates.
    If it does, it should be flagged by the debug tool from step 2&mdash;so you will know!
  </p>
  <p>
    If a custom template is set, and this is the only report using that template, you can then follow the procedure
    above to <a href="#un-split-view-files">un-split template files</a>. Prior to doing this, make sure to
    replace the <code>bootstrap3</code> path of this template with the <code>bootstrap5</code> path.
    You can then update the template's HTML as needed.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    If this template is referenced by several reports, consider adding that template to the
    <code>COMMON_REPORT_TEMPLATES</code> list in <code>corehq.apps.hqwebapp.utils.bootstrap.reports.debug</code>
    after migrating it. Other reports will then automatically select the <code>bootstrap5</code> version
    of this template when <code>use_bootstrap5</code> is set to <code>True</code>.
  </div>

  <h4 class="pt-2">4. Migrate filters and any related javascript</h4>
  <p>
    The report debugging tool should provide a list of filters that haven't been migrated.
    You should take the following steps:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Make sure that all related filters are visible in the report (you might have to enable feature flags).
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure all the filters modify the report as expected, without javascript errors.
      Update related javascript as necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure any buttons on the page work as expected.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h4 class="pt-2">4. Commit your changes and save progress</h4>
  <p>
    Once you are done migrating the report, you must use the following migration
    tool to mark the report and its filters as complete:
  </p>

  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">./manage.py complete_bootstrap5_report &lt;ReportClassName&gt;</pre>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3 id="deploy-to-staging" class="pt-3">
    Deploy to Staging
  </h3>
  <p>
    Once you have your migrated view working locally, it is also helpful to deploy to staging and smoke test there.
    This is particularly important for migrations that involve switching a JavaScript library from a Bootstrap 3 to
    Bootstrap 5 version, such as switching the Bootstrap 3 date picker with Botostrap 5-compatible tempus dominus.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most view migrations should also go through QA. Migrations can skip QA if they make
    relatively superficial changes and are in low-risk areas.
  </p>

  <h3 id="rebuild-diffs" class="pt-3">
    Rebuild Diffs
  </h3>
  <p>
    It is likely that you will have to run <code>build_bootstrap5_diffs</code> after the view migration. This will
    regenerate any diffs on split files affected by these changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before you rebuild diffs, please update the <code>bootstrap5_diff_config.json</code> file with the
    command below:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">./manage.py build_bootstrap5_diffs --update_app &lt;app_name&gt;</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    You can then commit those changes, if any, and then re run <code>build_bootstrap5_diffs</code> without
    the <code>update_app</code> option to rebuild the diffs for split files.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    <strong>Important:</strong> Please refrain from including commits from <code>build_bootstrap5_diffs</code>
    in the branch you push to staging, as it might introduce conflicts with other branches working on the Boostrap
    migration. Please add these diff commits right before making your Pull Request, when you are confident
    the migration changes are working as expected on staging.
  </div>

  <h2 id="completing-migration" class="pt-4">
    Step 4: Completing the App Migration
  </h2>
  <p>
    An app is considered fully migrated when all split files created in "Step 2" have been "un-split" and
    moved back to their original location. These files now fully inherit from <code>boostrap5</code> base
    templates and dependencies.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you have reached this point in the app migration, it's time to move on to the next application.
    Please update the app's migration status
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tkSXR643Da-fp6a-uYPa5dYs5if4W2LqtvUJs3IfUKs/edit#gid=0"
       target="_blank">in this table</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can run the following command to mark the application as complete:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">./manage.py complete_bootstrap5_migration &lt;app_name&gt;</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Please make sure you re-run <code>build_bootstrap5_diffs</code> with the <code>update_app</code> option as
    described above. If there are any changes, please commit those and then re-run <code>build_bootstrap5_diffs</code>
    without the <code>update_app</code> option.
  </p>

  <h2 id="final-cleanup" class="pt-4">
    Final Cleanup Process
  </h2>
  <p>
    Once all of the apps have completed the migration process, it will be time to do the final global cleanup of
    HQ. This involves making <code>bootstrap5</code> the default behavior for templates by removing any split
    code changes referencing <code>request.use_bootstrap5</code> or <code>get_bootstrap_version()</code> in
    templates, template tags, and other files.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once these changes are complete, the <code>@use_bootstrap5</code> decorator can be removed from all the views.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, the <code>use_bootstrap5</code> class variable can be removed from all the reports. Cleanup
    of the <code>bootstrap3</code> templates listed in <code>COMMON_REPORT_TEMPLATES</code> in
    <code>corehq.apps.hqwebapp.utils.bootstrap.reports.debug</code> can also be completed, as well as the
    filter templates marked completed by <code>manage.py complete_bootstrap5_report</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, <code>build_requirejs</code> can be updated to only build <code>bootstrap5</code> version of files, with
    the split <code>requirejs_config.js</code> files no longer needed, and the
    <a href="https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/hqwebapp/management/commands/build_requirejs.py#L147-L149"
       target="_blank">split_bundles</a> map in <code>build_requirejs</code> can be removed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, LESS files can be removed from all parts of HQ and <code>COMPRESS_PRECOMPILERS</code> in
    <code>settings.py</code> can be updated to only precompile SCSS. Any LESS-related dependencies can be removed from
    <code>package.json</code> and commcare-cloud, and new developer setup guides like <code>DEV_SETUP.md</code> can
    be updated to remove references to LESS.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you have completed the above changes, it is time to think about updating this guide to reflect on
    the process of this migration and suggestions for how to handle future migrations. LESS-related references will
    likely no longer be needed for future migrations, as Boostrap will stay on SASS/SCSS, so it will be fine to remove
    support for that. However, it might be good to leave pointers to commits, files, and other resources that
    we have used to support this migration. This page can then serve as the starting point for anyone embarking on
    a future (and hopefully less painful) challenge of the next Bootstrap Migration.
