    Overview
  </h2>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    At present, HQ is undergoing a migration from Bootstrap 3 to Bootstrap 5. At the end of this migration, please
    update this notice and leave this page as documentation for the next Bootstrap migration.
  </div>
  <p>
    We are taking an app-by-app approach to migrating from Bootstrap 3 to 5. This process is summarized by the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Using an automated process, split template and javascript files that need changes into <code>bootstrap3</code>
        and <code>bootstrap5</code> versions. This process will find/replace the straightforward changes and flag
        more complex changes to be addressed later.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Migrate views in the app one-by-one by applying the <code>@use_bootstrap5</code> decorator and
        ensuring template and javascript files for that view inherit from <code>bootstrap5</code> base templates
        and javascript dependencies. This process will be visual in nature, and may involve updates to the
        Bootstrap 5 stylesheet and/or restructuring HTML and javascript components to ensure the view renders properly
        with no javascript errors.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Once <code>bootstrap3</code> versions of a template or javascript file are no longer referenced, the
        <code>bootstrap5</code> version can be "un-split" and the file moved back to the original location prior to
        the split.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        An app will be considered fully migrated when all template and javascript files are no longer split into
        <code>bootstrap3</code> and <code>bootstrap5</code> versions and every view in the app is decorated with
        <code>@use_bootstrap5</code>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Once all apps are fully migrated to Bootstrap 5, we can then remove the use of the any in-template splits
        referencing <code>request.use_boostrap5</code>, so that any Bootstrap 3 related code is removed. Lastly, a final
        cleanup should be done to remove the <code>@use_bootstrap5</code> decorator from all the views.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="prepare-local-environment" class="pt-4">
    Prepare Local Environment
  </h2>
  <p>
    If you haven't done so, you will need to install Dart Sass to compile
    <code>scss</code> files. The recommended method is with homebrew <code>brew install sass/sass/sass</code>,
    as described in <code>DEV_SETUP.md</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, you will need to specify <code>BOOTSTRAP_MIGRATION_LOGS_DIR</code> in <code>localsettings.py</code>. This
    will be where the migration management command will leave longer notes for each migrated file.
  </p>

  <h2 id="announce-migration" class="pt-3">
    Step 1: Announce Migration
  </h2>
  <p>
    Before you begin the migration of an app, please announce your intention to do so in <code>#gtd-dev</code>. It is
    important to communicate timelines for how long you expect the "split files" stage to last. Additionally, please
    ask that people refrain from any front-end development in that app until changes from the split files step have
    been merged.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    <strong>Important:</strong>
    After announcing your intent to migrate the app, please update the app's migration status
    <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tkSXR643Da-fp6a-uYPa5dYs5if4W2LqtvUJs3IfUKs/edit#gid=0"
       target="_blank">in this table</a></strong>. This is also a good place to see what apps have not been migrated yet, if
    you are in need of ideas.
  </div>

  <h2 id="split-files" class="pt-4">
    Step 2: Split Files
  </h2>
  <p>
    The next step is to split affected template and javascript files into <code>bootstrap3</code> and
    <code>bootstrap5</code> versions. This is an automated process that uses a management command to find and
    replace the straightforward changes, while flagging more complex changes to be addressed later.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pre-work: Your life will be easier if you lint the app's JavaScript <em>before</em> the migration script
    duplicates every js file. This is usually not arduous. To find lint errors, make sure you have
    <a href="https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started#quick-start">eslint installed locally</a> and then
    run:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">npx eslint corehq/apps/&lt;app_name&gt;</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    If you can, please cherry-pick these lint commits into a separate PR and merge those changes before creating
    the PR to split the files.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    <strong>Important:</strong> Avoid including lint fixes and split-files changes in the SAME commit.
    These changes MUST be separated.
  </div>
  <p>
    Now, on to the migration.
    Please set aside focused time to PR these changes as soon as possible to avoid any migration conflicts or
    missed renamed references, especially in parts of the codebase that are undergoing frequent front-end changes. This
    initial "split file" Pull Request should <strong>only</strong> contain changes automatically made by the management command.
    Additional changes should be made in subsequent PRs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use the management command below with <code>&lt;app_name&gt;</code> being the
    name of the application you would like to migrate:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">./manage.py migrate_app_to_bootstrap5 &lt;app_name&gt;</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    For instance, if you want to migrate <code>corehq.apps.reminders</code>, you would use <code>reminders</code> as
    <code>&lt;app_name&gt;</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The management command will iterate through all template and javascript files in the app. You have the option to
    review and accept each change line-by-line or review the diff for each file at the end.
    A changelog for each file will be saved to a markdown file in <code>BOOTSTRAP_MIGRATION_LOGS_DIR</code>.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    Due to potential merge conflict issues, the markdown files outputted to <code>BOOTSTRAP_MIGRATION_LOGS_DIR</code>
    are not version controlled. If you want to work on migrating an application with multiple people, you can zip
    these markdown files and share with your collaborators for future reference.
  </div>
  <p>
    Once a file is updated and split into the two bootstrap versions, the command will
    find references to the original filepath and replace them with the filepath to the <code>bootstrap3</code> version.
  </p>
  <p>
    After applying all the actions related to splitting a file, it is recommended to commit those changes before
    moving on to the next file. The management command will prompt you to do this with a suggested commit message.
    Formatting our commits this way is important to maintain a clean git history.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    <p>
      It is possible that you might have to run a migration multiple times on an app. It might be the case that templates
      or javascript files have several nested dependencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, let's suppose one template called <code>webapps_base.html</code> is
      split into <code>bootstrap3</code> and <code>bootstrap5</code> versions. In that same run of
      <code>migrate_app_to_bootstrap5</code>, a template called <code>question.html</code> was already checked but
      never split because it did not contain code needing an upgrade. However, this template extends
      <code>webapps_base.html</code>, so it does need to be split.
    </p>
    <p>
      When <code>webapps_base.html</code> is renamed to a <code>bootstrap3</code> path, the <code>extend</code> path
      in <code>question.html</code> is also updated. Since <code>question.html</code> was checked before
      <code>webapps_base.html</code>, the migration script did not catch that <code>question.html</code> now extends from
      a <code>bootstrap3</code> template. A second run of <code>migrate_app_to_bootstrap5</code> would catch this and
      accurately split <code>question.html</code>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3 id="update-diffs" class="pt-3">
    Configure &amp; Update Diffs
  </h3>
  <p>
    Since an app migration usually takes several weeks, we need to ensure that any changes
    made to <code>bootstrap3</code> templates during this time are kept in sync with their <code>bootstrap5</code>
    counterparts. We do this by saving diffs of the split files and running tests against them to ensure diffs stay the
    same. Once changes are made to both split files, the diffs can be regenerated so that tests continue to pass.
  </p>
  <p>
    As <code>migrate_app_to_bootstrap5</code> iterates through each template and javascript directory,
    it will create new <code>bootstrap3</code> and <code>bootstrap5</code> directories.
    For instance <code>app_manager/base_template.html</code> now becomes
    <code>app_manager/bootstrap3/base_template.html</code> and <code>app_manager/bootstrap5/base_template.html</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    When new split directories are created, please ensure the paths to these directories are added to
    <a href="https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/hqwebapp/tests/data/bootstrap5_diff_config.json" target="_blank">
      bootstrap5_diff_config.json
    </a> and commit those changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    For most applications, you can just run the following command to automatically update <code>bootstrap5_diff_config.json</code>:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">./manage.py build_bootstrap5_diffs --update_app &lt;app_name&gt;</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Once those changes (if any) are committed, please run the following management command and commit the results:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">./manage.py build_bootstrap5_diffs</pre>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3 id="verify-references" class="pt-3">
    Verify References
  </h3>
  <p>
    Right before submitting the "split files" Pull Request, it is important to rebase the latest <code>master</code>
    branch into your working branch and run the following command:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">./manage.py migrate_app_to_bootstrap5 &lt;app_name&gt; --verify-references</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    This will iterate through all the split <code>bootstrap3</code> files in the app and ensure that references to the
    old file (without <code>bootstrap3/</code> in the filepath) are updated to the <ocde>bootstrap3</ocde> path.
    The reason why we do this right before making the pull request is so that any changes merged into master since
    the split files process began are checked for references so that we can avoid any 404s or 500s.
  </p>
  <p>
    After verifying references, it might be necessary to run <code>build_bootstrap5_diffs</code> again before finally
    opening the Pull Request.
  </p>

  <h2 id="update-stylesheets" class="pt-4">
    Step 2B: Migrate Stylesheets
  </h2>
  <p>
    Some larger applications, like the App Builder and Web Apps, have their own stylesheets that add or modify styles
    on top of the main stylesheet. Since Bootstrap 5 has moved to using SASS / SCSS instead of LESS, <code>less</code>
    files that are part of the app undergoing a migration will need to be migrated from <code>less</code> to
    <code>scss</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The process for this step in the migration is not automated due to the rarity and complexity of this requirement.
    You can begin this process by creating parallel <code>scss</code> files for all the existing <code>less</code>
    files. The contents can be copied over from <code>less</code> to <code>scss</code> and the syntax updated to
    use SCSS style variables and mixins.
    <a href="https://www.martyfriedel.com/blog/moving-from-less-to-scss" target="_blank">Here is a guide</a> to
    help with those changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is important to update any variables from the old Bootstrap 3 stylesheet to their Bootstrap 5 counterparts.
    Please work closely with the lead developer of the Bootstrap migration, so you can receive guidance to do this
    part accurately.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    It is important to create a separate Pull Request for stylesheet changes. This PR should come after the "split files"
    changes in the previous step.
  </div>
  <p>
    You will have to update <code>bootstrap5_diff_config.json</code> manually when working with stylesheet files.
    To confirm which directories to add, check your app for directories with "bootstrap3" in the name:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">find corehq/apps/&lt;app_name&gt; -type d | grep bootstrap3</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    You can then see existing stylesheet file configuration in the config file as an example for how to update it
    for your stylesheets.
  </p>

  <h2 id="migrating-views" class="pt-4">
    Step 3: Migrating Views
  </h2>
  <p>
    The next step is to migrate the app's views one-by-one. It is recommended to make a pull request for each view
    or group of small related views, rather than migrating a lot of views and having a very large Pull Request.
  </p>
  <p>
    The migration process begins by either applying <code>@use_bootstrap5</code> decorator the view function or
    <code>@method_decorator(use_bootstrap5, name='dispatch')</code> to the view class.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, you should go into the view template and ensure that this template inherits from <code>bootstrap5</code>
    base templates.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, you should make sure any javascript files needed to render that view also inherit from <code>bootstrap5</code>
    dependencies. As you migrate a view's requirejs module, it is important to update the
    <a href="https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/hqwebapp/management/commands/build_requirejs.py#L147-L149"
       target="_blank">split_bundles</a>
    map in <code>build_requirejs</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once a view's template and javascript files updated, it is now time to load that view make visual observations and
    make adjustments to get the view to render without javascript or visual errors. The view should be as similar
    as possible to its Bootstrap 3 version, which you can compare with on production.
  </p>
  <p>
    A pixel-perfect migration from Bootstrap 3 to Bootstrap 5 will likely not be possible for each page, as Bootstrap 5
    has removed several components (like <code>panel</code>, for instance) and replaced them with new components
    (like <code>cards</code>). The migration helper <code>migrate_app_to_bootstrap5</code> should help with
    guidance for making more complex replacements of removed components.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    The most important part of the migration is ensuring that the page is functionally similar to the user and that no
    errors are present on the page that were not previously present in the Bootstrap 3 version.
  </div>
  <p>
    There is a chance you might have to introduce changes to the stylesheet if you come across a custom component that
    has not yet been migrated to Bootstrap 5. If this is the case, please flag this component with the lead developer
    of the Bootstrap migration. They can assist with updating the stylesheet (if necessary) or updating guidance
    for replacing this component with Bootstrap 5 best practices.
  </p>

  <h3 id="un-split-view-files" class="pt-3">
    Un-Split View Files
  </h3>
  <p>
    Once your view is functional under the Bootstrap 5 changes, check to see whether the <code>boostrap3</code> versions
    of your template or javascript files are being referenced elsewhere. If not, it is time to "un-split" that template
    by removing the <code>bootstrap3</code> version of that file and moving the <code>bootstrap5</code> version into
    the file's original location before the split.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the file you are un-splitting is a template, run:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">./manage.py complete_bootstrap5_migration &lt;app_name&gt; --template &lt;filename&gt;</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    If the file you are un-splitting is a javascript file, run:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">./manage.py complete_bootstrap5_migration &lt;app_name&gt; --javascript &lt;filename&gt;</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Please follow the guidance of the <code>complete_bootstrap5_migration</code> management commands for suggested
    commit messages and when to commit changes.
  </p>

  <h3 id="deploy-to-staging" class="pt-3">
    Deploy to Staging
  </h3>
  <div class="alert alert-danger">
    <strong>IMPORTANT: Do not skip this step!</strong> Please deploy to staging to avoid any fires. You have been warned.
  </div>
  <p>
    Once you have your migrated view working locally, it is important to deploy your view's branch to staging to ensure
    that the requirejs build doesn't encounter any issues and that there are no other staticfiles or javascript
    issues with this view. It is often the case that the production environment introduces front-end issues that are
    often not discovered when testing locally, due to the complexity of the requirejs build, django compressor, caching,
    and content distribution of static files.
  </p>

  <h3 id="rebuild-diffs" class="pt-3">
    Rebuild Diffs
  </h3>
  <p>
    It is likely that you will have to run <code>build_bootstrap5_diffs</code> after the view migration. This will
    regenerate any diffs on split files affected by these changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before you rebuild diffs, please update the <code>bootstrap5_diff_config.json</code> file with the
    command below:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">./manage.py build_bootstrap5_diffs --update_app &lt;app_name&gt;</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    You can then commit those changes, if any, and then re run <code>build_bootstrap5_diffs</code> without
    the <code>update_app</code> option to rebuild the diffs for split files.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    <strong>Important:</strong> Please refrain from including commits from <code>build_bootstrap5_diffs</code>
    in the branch you push to staging, as it might introduce conflicts with other branches working on the Boostrap
    migration. Please add these diff commits right before making your Pull Request, when you are confident
    the migration changes are working as expected on staging.
  </div>

  <h2 id="completing-migration" class="pt-4">
    Step 4: Completing the App Migration
  </h2>
  <p>
    An app is considered fully migrated when all split files created in "Step 2" have been "un-split" and
    moved back to their original location. These files now fully inherit from <code>boostrap5</code> base
    templates and dependencies.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you have reached this point in the app migration, it's time to move on to the next application.
    Please update the app's migration status
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tkSXR643Da-fp6a-uYPa5dYs5if4W2LqtvUJs3IfUKs/edit#gid=0"
       target="_blank">in this table</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can run the following command to mark the application as complete:
  </p>
  <div class="card text-bg-light mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="m-0">./manage.py complete_bootstrap5_migration &lt;app_name&gt;</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Please make sure you re-run <code>build_bootstrap5_diffs</code> with the <code>update_app</code> option as
    described above. If there are any changes, please commit those and then re-run <code>build_bootstrap5_diffs</code>
    without the <code>update_app</code> option.
  </p>

  <h2 id="final-cleanup" class="pt-4">
    Final Cleanup Process
  </h2>
  <p>
    Once all of the apps have completed the migration process, it will be time to do the final global cleanup of
    HQ. This involves making <code>bootstrap5</code> the default behavior for templates by removing any split
    code changes referencing <code>request.use_bootstrap5</code> or <code>get_bootstrap_version()</code> in
    templates, template tags, and other files.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once these changes are complete, the <code>@use_bootstrap5</code> decorator can be removed from all the views.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, <code>build_requirejs</code> can be updated to only build <code>bootstrap5</code> version of files, with
    the split <code>requirejs_config.js</code> files no longer needed, and the
    <a href="https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/hqwebapp/management/commands/build_requirejs.py#L147-L149"
       target="_blank">split_bundles</a> map in <code>build_requirejs</code> can be removed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, LESS files can be removed from all parts of HQ and <code>COMPRESS_PRECOMPILERS</code> in
    <code>settings.py</code> can be updated to only precompile SCSS. Any LESS-related dependencies can be removed from
    <code>packange.json</code> and commcare-cloud, and new developer setup guides like <code>DEV_SETUP.md</code> can
    be updated to remove references to LESS.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you have completed the above changes, it is time to think about updating this guide to reflect on
    the process of this migration and suggestions for how to handle future migrations. LESS-related references will
    likely no longer be needed for future migrations, as Boostrap will stay on SASS/SCSS, so it will be fine to remove
    support for that. However, it might be good to leave pointers to commits, files, and other resources that
    we have used to support this migration. This page can then serve as the starting point for anyone embarking on
    a future (and hopefully less painful) challenge of the next Bootstrap Migration.
