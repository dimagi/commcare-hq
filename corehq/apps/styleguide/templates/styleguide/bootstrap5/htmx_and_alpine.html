    Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://htmx.org/" target="_blank">HTMX</a> and <a href="https://alpinejs.dev/" target="_blank">Alpine</a>
    are two lightweight JavaScript libraries that work well together to add interactivity to a page without
    needing to add a ton of custom javascript. They work through clever usage of HTML attributes.
  </p>
  <p>
    HTMX is particularly suited for a Django environment like ours as it expects asynchronous responses to
    be HTML (instead of JSON), meaning we can return partial templates as responses. This allows us to utilize
    more of Django's backend power, rather than having to re-create a ton of logic in the front end.
  </p>
  <h3 id="getting-started" class="pt-3">
    Getting Started
  </h3>
  <p>
    If you want to quickly get started, you can use this <code>js_entry</code> point
    <code>hqwebapp/js/htmx_and_alpine</code> (no additional configuration necessary) and
    include <code>hqwebapp/htmx/error_modal.html</code> in the <code>modals</code> block of your page.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_display.html' with content=examples.htmx_get_started %}
  <p>
    Right now HTMX and Alpine are only available on pages using Webpack. If you don't know what this means,
    please read the
    <a href="https://commcare-hq.readthedocs.io/js-guide/static-files.html" target="_blank">Overview of Static Files
    and JavaScript Bundlers</a>. If you don't know how to proceed after that, read further.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    <strong>Important:</strong> HTMX and Alpine can only be included on pages using Webpack as the JavaScript bundler
    due to limitations with RequireJS. See the guide for
    <a
        href="https://commcare-hq.readthedocs.io/js-guide/requirejs-to-webpack.html"
        target="_blank"
    >Migrating RequireJS to Webpack</a> if you have an older page you would like
    to use HTMX and Alpine on. If the page is even older (no bundler), we currently do not have a solution
    for this.
  </div>

  <h2 id="usage-forms" class="pt-4">
    Usage with Forms
  </h2>
  <p>
    HTMX and Alpine are well suited for sprinkling bits of interactivity into an otherwise very static form.
    For instance, we want to hide or show a field depending on the value of a select input.
  </p>
  <p>
    The in-page interactivity is handled by Alpine. HTMX is useful because it allows us to submit (and load)
    the form asynchronously.
  </p>
  <h3 id="usage-forms-demo" class="pt-3">
    Demo with Crispy Forms
  </h3>
  <p>
    <a href="{% url "sg_htmx_alpine_form_demo" %}" target="_blank">Take a look at this simple demo</a> of how
    we might use HTMX and Alpine with Crispy Forms. Tip: Make sure you are logged in.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below we have two template views, <code>HtmxAlpineFormDemoView</code> and <code>FilterDemoFormView</code>.
    <code>HtmxAlpineFormDemoView</code> is the view that loads when visiting the URL above. It can be considered
    the "host" view, and asynchronously loads the partial template content from the <code>FilterDemoFormView</code>
    on page load. <code>FilterDemoFormView</code> then controls everything related to the <code>FilterDemoForm</code>.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_display.html' with content=examples.htmx_alpine_form_views %}
  <p>
    Take a look at the template for <code>HtmxAlpineFormDemoView</code>. You can see it uses a common
    <code>js_entry</code> entry point <code>hqwebapp/js/htmx_and_alpine</code>, which is appropriate for
    most common uses of HTMX and Alpine.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_display.html' with content=examples.form_main_template %}
  <p>
    The template for <code>FilterDemoFormView</code> then looks like this&mdash;a very simple form partial!
    The magic of what happens after the form is submitted is in the <code>hx-</code> attributes within
    the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag that control the HTMX interactions.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_display.html' with content=examples.form_partial_template %}
  <p>
    The interaction within the form is then controlled by Alpine. Take a peek at <code>self.helper.layout</code>
    in the code below. All the <code>x_</code> attributes define the Alpine model and interactions&mdash;no
    external JavaScript file necessary!
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_display.html' with content=examples.htmx_alpine_form %}

  <h2 id="organization" class="pt-4">
    Organization for Complex Pages
  </h2>
  <p>
    You can imagine that if a page needs to make a lot of different HTMX requests for multiple page interactions,
    the view list needed to process each request might get pretty long. Additionally, it might be challenging to
    properly identify these views as related to one main view.
  </p>
  <p>
    That is where <code>HqHtmxActionMixin</code> comes in! You can use this mixin with any <code>TemplateView</code>
    (and common HQ subclasses, like <code>BasePageView</code>). Once mixed-in, any method on that view can be
    decorated with <code>@hq_hx_action()</code> to make that method name directly available as an "action"
    with any <code>hx-get</code>, <code>hx-post</code>, or related <code>hx-</code> request to that View's URL.
    This association can be made with the <code>hq-hx-action</code> attribute in the same element that has the
    <code>hx-</code> request tag.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not quite following? Yes, it's a bit complex. Let's check out a demo and hopefully that will clear up any
    confusion...
  </p>
  <h3 id="using-hqhtmxactionmixin" class="pt-3">
    Using <code>HqHtmxActionMixin</code>
  </h3>
  <p>
    To illustrate the usage of <code>HqHtmxActionMixin</code>, here is a simple
    <a href="{% url "sg_htmx_todo_list_example" %}" target="_blank">To-Do List</a> demo.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's first start with the <code>TodoListDemoView</code>, a subclass of <code>BasePageView</code> that mixes
    in <code>HqHtmxActionMixin</code>. You can see that the <code>@hq_hx_action()</code> decorator is applied
    to three methods in this view: <code>create_new_item</code>, <code>edit_item</code>, and
    <code>mark_item_done</code>.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_display.html' with content=examples.htmx_hq_hx_action %}
  <p>
    Looking at the main template for this view, we can scan the page for the first <code>hx-post</code>
    attribute, which posts to <code>request.path_info</code>. This is URL of the page serving this
    template: <code>TodoListDemoView</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below <code>hx-post</code> is the <code>hq-hx-action</code> attribute referencing the
    <code>create_new_item</code> method of the <code>TodoListDemoView</code>. Remember, this was one
    of the methods decorated with <code>@hq_hx_action()</code>. The rest of the attributes are specific to
    HTMX, and you can read more about them on <a href="https://htmx.org/" target="_blank">htmx.org</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you scan the rest of the template, you will notice another <code>hq-hx-action</code> attribute which
    references the method <code>does_not_exist</code>. As it is aptly named, this method does not exist in
    <code>TodoListDemoView</code>. However, that's the point, as this attribute is attached to a button which
    triggers the HTMX error modal. :)
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_display.html' with content=examples.htmx_todo_main %}
  <p>
    What about the other two actions, <code>edit_item</code> and <code>mark_item_done</code>? To examine the usage
    for these, we need to look at the <code>item.html</code> template.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this template, we see <code>hq_hx_action="mark_item_done"</code> applied to the <code>checkbox</code>
    input. Scrolling down, we see <code>hq_hx_action="edit_item"</code> applied to the <code>form</code>
    that contains the <code>input</code> with the edited form value.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, how is the quick inline-edit interaction happening? That all comes from Alpine! Looking at the
    attributes in the <code>li</code> element on that template, we see the simple Alpine model being defined,
    setting up variables to track the <code>isEditing</code> and <code>isSubmitting</code> states. Additionally,
    the <code>itemValue</code> is defined and initialized from the template variable <code>item.name</code>. This
    <code>itemValue</code> is bound to the text <code>input</code> in the <code>edit_item</code> form below, with
    Alpine's <code>x-model</code> attribute.
  </p>
  <p>
    The hide/show states of other elements are then controlled with Alpine's <code>x-show</code> attribute,
    while other form elements are disabled using Alpine's <code>:disabled</code> shorthand attribute when the
    <code>isEditing</code> or <code>isSubmitting</code> states change.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_display.html' with content=examples.htmx_todo_item %}
  <p>
    From the code in <code>TodoListDemoView</code>, you can see that a request to the different
    <code>@hq_hx_action()</code> methods returns <code>self.render_item_response</code>. This returns
    <code>render_htmx_partial_response</code>, which is part of the <code>HqHtmxActionMixin</code>.
    Looking at this <code>render_item_response</code> method, we see two partial templates being returned.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>item.html</code> template we've already examined above. However, when the item is marked as
    <code>is_done</code>, the method returns the <code>item_done_oob_swap.html</code> partial. Let's take a
    look at this template:
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_display.html' with content=examples.htmx_todo_item_done_swap %}
  <p>
    As you can see, this template just adds a wrapper around the <code>item_done.html</code> template, but
    it has a very interesting HTMX attribute in this wrapper, <code>hx-swap-oob</code>. This was included
    to demonstrate a powerful feature of HTMX to do out-of-bounds swaps, which you can
    <a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap-oob/" target="_blank">read about here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, we have the <code>item_done.html</code> partial template. It's very simple:
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_display.html' with content=examples.htmx_todo_item_done %}
  <p>
    That's it! Hopefully <code>HqHtmxActionMixin</code> seems less confusing now,
    and you are inspired to use it. :)
  </p>

  <h2 id="debugging" class="pt-4">
    Debugging During Development
  </h2>
  <p>
    During development of a page using <code>HTMX</code>, you might be interested in seeing how the page
    looks like when requests take a long time to load, or when the server is a little flaky. Unfortunately,
    when you try to use the browser dev tools to simulate page slowness, you are only delaying sending the
    request to your local server, rather than simulating a slow server response. The distinction is important
    with HTMX, especially when debugging timeout issues.
  </p>
  <p>
    To enable some advanced debugging features on a view using the <code>HqHtmxActionMixin</code>, you
    can also mix-in the <code>HqHtmxDebugMixin</code>. The <code>HqHtmxDebugMixin</code> allows you to
    simulate slow server responses by setting <code>simulate_slow_response = True</code> on your view.
    You can also simulate intermittent bad gateway errors with <code>simulate_flaky_gateway = True</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can check out the <code>HqHtmxDebugMixin</code> directly for additional documentation and usage
    guidance.
  </p>

  <h2 id="loading-indicators" class="pt-4">
    Loading Indicators
  </h2>
  <p>
    You can use the <code>hx-indicator</code> attribute
    (<a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-indicator/" target="_blank">see docs here</a>)
    to mark which element gets the <code>htmx-request</code> class appended to it during a request.
    We've added custom styling to <code>_htmx.scss</code> to support the common states outlined
    later in this section.
  </p>
  <p>
    By default, if an element triggers an HTMX request, it will automatically get the <code>htmx-request</code>
    CSS class applied to it. No extra usage of the <code>hx-indicator</code> attribute is necessary. The
    example submitting elements below showcase this default behavior <strong>without</strong> the need for
    specific <code>hx-indicator</code> usage.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's often a great idea to pair button requests with <code>hx-disabled-elt="this"</code>
    (<a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-disabled-elt/" target="_blank`">see docs for hx-disabled-elt</a>),
    like the examples below, so that the requesting element or related element is disabled during the request.
  </p>
  <h3 id="button-loading" class="pt-4">
    Buttons
  </h3>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_display.html' with content=examples.loading_button %}

  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap5/code_display.html' with content=examples.loading_checkbox %}

  <h3 id="form-loading" class="pt-4">
    Forms
  </h3>
  <p>
    In the example below, note that the <code>form</code> is the triggering element, so the
    <code>hx-disabled-elt</code> value is set to <code>find button</code> to disable all button children
    of that form during an HTMX request. Since <code>form</code> is the submitting element, by default
    it has the <code>htmx-request</code> class applied. Our styles ensure that
    <code>button type="submit"</code> elements of a submitting form show the loading indicator during
    an HTMX request.
