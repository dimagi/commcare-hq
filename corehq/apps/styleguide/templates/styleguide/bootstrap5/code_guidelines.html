    Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
    Most of us don’t write much CSS. HQ uses
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap 5.3</a>, which
    gives us a consistent and fairly comprehensive set of styles. Most of the "styling" we do is
    picking the appropriate Bootstrap (or HQ) classes and then troubleshooting anything unexpected.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS / SCSS</a> to write styles.
    SASS is a powerful extension of CSS that allows for more maintainable and reusable styling
    by supporting variables, mixins, and so much more. SCSS is a flavor of SASS with a syntax
    closer to CSS syntax where the use of semicolons and braces are mandatory.
    Since Bootstrap 5 uses the SCSS flavor of SASS, we also have chosen to use SCSS.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reusable CSS is good for the same reasons reusable code is good everywhere else. On the front end,
    reusable code is also correlated with visual consistency and generally better UX. To that end, when
    creating a new page or section:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It should look very similar to related HQ pages.</li>
    <li>It should look fairly similar to other HQ pages.</li>
    <li>It should look somewhat like the rest of the internet.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Bootstrap takes care of a lot this: it gives us a consistent framework so our pages look like each other,
    and that framework is designed to resemble the rest of the internet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Good styling is <strong>semantic</strong>, because that makes it easier for other developers to reuse.
    Ideally, a visual designer decides what an error looks like, or what a CRUD page looks like, and then
    developers only need to determine that they're displaying an error, or creating a CRUD page, and the look
    and feel is taken care of.
  </p>
  <p>
    Classes like <code>.bump-down { margin-top: 10px; }</code> are problematic because it isn't clear when
    and why they should be used, so they get applied inconsistently, and we end up with a site that looks
    a little bit...off...but it isn't obvious why. Bootstrap is a good example of a largely semantic system:
    classes have names like <code>.btn-danger</code> rather than <code>.btn-red</code>, to make it clear <strong>why</strong>
    you should use a particular class.
  </p>

  <h2 id="style-hierarchy" class="pt-4">
    Style Hierarchy
  </h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Most styling should live in external SCSS files.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most HQ-specific styling lives in external SCSS files, typically in
    <code>corehq/apps/hqwebapp/static/hqwebapp/scss</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    App-specific styling
    can live in <code>corehq/apps/style/static/APPNAME/scss</code> and then be
    included with <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags in the appropriate template.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some pages use in-page <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> blocks. This isn't ideal for two reasons:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In-page styles can't be reused by other pages - but for the sake of a consistent experience,
      most styling shouldn't be specific to a single page.
    </li>
    <li>
      In-page styles can't use SCSS, so they tend to be less DRY and has to hard-code values like
      colors and dimensions, rather than using the standard values stored in SCSS.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Inline styling is generally a bad idea for the same reasons as in-page styling: one-off styling
    isn't good for consistency and often isn't semantic.
  </p>

  <h2 id="z-index" class="pt-4">
    Handling Z-Index
  </h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Disorganized z-indices lead to highly visible bugs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Z-index gives you control over the stacking order of elements. The challenge is that
    it acts like a global variable and, like any global variable, gets hard to keep track of.
    HQ deals with this as best as it can, by declaring numeric z-index values as variables in
    <a href="https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/hqwebapp/static/hqwebapp/scss/commcarehq/_variables.scss">variables.scss</a>
    and using the variables in other SCSS files. This isn't perfect, but it at least gives us
    one place to define HQ-specific absolute z-index values - which also need to play nicely
    with Bootstrap's z-index list.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most z-index issues arise from not having a good handle on all of the different values
    used in an application, but there are a few other complexities that occasionally cause problems:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li class="pb-2">
      Stacking levels: Z index isn't the only aspect of element stacking. Stacking is also affected
      by element positioning and floating.
      <a href="http://vanseodesign.com/css/css-stack-z-index/">
        "Natural" stacking order, from top to bottom:
      </a>
      <ul>
        <li>Positive z-index</li>
        <li>z-index auto or 0</li>
        <li>Inline elements</li>
        <li>Floated elements</li>
        <li>Block-level elements</li>
        <li>Negative z-index</li>
        <li>Background</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Stacking context: Z-index isn't strictly global, it acts within a stacking context. There's a
      global context but may also be sub-contexts within that. The most common of these is that an
      element with a non-auto z-index creates a stacking context. This is intuitive: if you set a modal
      to <code>z-index: 9999</code>, you don’t have to set the z-index on all of its children to 1000,
      they just come along for the ride. But there are other properties that also create new stacking
      contexts where you might not expect it. <code>position: fixed</code> is one, translucent elements
      is another.
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context">
        The others are pretty obscure.
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
