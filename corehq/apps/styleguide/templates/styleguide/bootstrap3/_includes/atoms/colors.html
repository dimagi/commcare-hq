    As described <a href='#atoms-accessibility'>above</a>, many people are affected by various types of <strong>color blindness</strong>.
    It is important to make sure that colors are <em>never</em> the source
    of critical information. Also, when colors are used to compare information
    (legend of a bar or line chart) it is important that the colors used
    can be differentiated by people with each type of color blindness.
