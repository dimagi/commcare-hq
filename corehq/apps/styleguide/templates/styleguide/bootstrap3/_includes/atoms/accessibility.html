  <h1 id="atoms-accessibility">Accessibility</h1>

  <p class="lead">
    Dimagi’s product design team firmly believes that web and software experiences should be accessible for everyone,
    regardless of abilities or impairments.
  </p>

  <p>
    This guide will help ensure that our experiences meet the standards for
    accessibility required by law (WCAG AA, Section 508, European Standards). Patterns should be perceivable, operable,
    and understandable to users, even when using assistive technology.
  </p>

  <p>
    Accessible products give every user the same benefits regardless of ability and can adapt to any user in any
    context. Disabilities can be situational (an end user with typical vision may struggle to view their screen in a
    bright or sunny environment), temporary (a person with a broken wrist may not be able to type in HQ but will regain
    ability when healed), and long-lasting (barriers from birth, an illness, disease, accident, or developed over age;
    some may not consider themselves to have disabilities even if they experience functional limitations). We design
    and build products for everyone.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Everyone" includes
  <ul>
    <li>
      18% of adults with vision impairment
      (<a href="http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment">source</a>)
    </li>
    <li>
      8.6% of adults with hearing trouble (16.8% of U.S. adults!)
      (<a href="https://www.who.int/deafness/en/">source</a>
      and
      <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/disability.htm">source</a>)
    </li>
    <li>
      15% of adults with physical functioning difficulty
      (<a href="http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health">source</a>
      and
      <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/disability.htm">source</a>)
    </li>
    <li>
      4.4% of adults with cognitive disabilities
      (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/disability.htm">source</a>)
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Consider the following barriers when designing and coding
  <ul>
    <li>
      Blindness (may use screen reader, lack access to mouse, rely on text over visual information
    </li>
    <li>
      Low-Vision (may use screen readers/magnifiers, high contrast or monochrome displays; maximize readability and visual clarity; try NoCoffee plugin
    </li>
    <li>
      Color-blindness (may not be able to differentiate between some colors; test designs in a color-blind simulator)
    </li>
    <li>
      Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (may rely on captioning and alternative representations of audio
    </li>
    <li>
      Physical Disabilities (may rely on keyboards, trackballs, voice recognition or assistive tech, may lack mouse access
    </li>
    <li>
      Cognitive Disabilities (may have limited working memory, problem solving, attention, reading/linguistic/visual comprehension,
      sensitivity to flashing content; try to design linearly and focus on heuristics that have to do with cognitive load and memory)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Throughout the documentation, when possible, we will call out A11y. For example, checking color contrast in
    the buttons. We aim for AA compliant color contrast. You can check color contrast in tools such as
    <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/</a>.

    In 2020, USH began a web accessibility improvement effort, specifically surrounding screen readers.
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fHNaVlaFl1xrbtPbMqj0YpByss1e0_hzCRlAUbVLboM/edit?usp=sharing">This document</a> details
    an overview of the effort, deficiencies found by an outside agency of CommCare, recommendations, and resources.

    Quick ways to test for web accessibility*
  <ul>
    <li>
      Keyboard Navigation: Testing if modified code is navigable by keyboard is an effective way to
      test for accessibility. Many users rely on keyboard navigation that are otherwise unable to use a mouse and it’s
      also a good indicator if it will be visible to a screen reader. Read more about potential barriers to effective
      keyboard navigation and keyboard testing <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/">here</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Explore the accessibility tree: An accessibility tree is a part of your website's DOM. All
      accessible objects are created in the accessibility tree for each DOM element that needs to be exposed to
      assistive technologies. From it, you can see how the page elements are included and organized. To view the
      accessibility tree of a page under development, we can use
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/accessibility/reference">Chrome DevTools' accessibility feature</a>.
