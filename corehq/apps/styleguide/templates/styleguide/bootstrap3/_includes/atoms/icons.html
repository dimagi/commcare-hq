    Visual communication can be essential in scanning and understanding for populations whose first language
    may not be English.  Please be sympathetic with the goal of cohesion and don’t use an icon for a purpose it
    was not intended for.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consistent iconography in any user interface is critical to creating
    a product that is highly accessible across all different levels of
    literacy. Icons may need to be localized for different cultures and languages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Good icons use <strong>simple, graphic shapes</strong> so they can be understood even at a small size.
    They have little detail. They are as <strong>universal</strong> as possible, consistent with other
    platforms.
  </p>

  <h2>Primary vs Secondary Icons</h2>
  <p>
    Primary icons are used for <strong>navigation</strong> or <strong>interaction</strong>.
    Primary icons are interactive, they change the surround environment or data. They likely don’t need to be coupled with text.
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondary icons <strong>provide clarity</strong>.
    Secondary icons are used <strong>before</strong> text to communicate topical information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of HQ's icons come from
    <a href="https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/cheatsheet/">FontAwesome</a>.
    All icons in FontAwesome are already built into HQ.
    Other icons have been custom created for HQ.
