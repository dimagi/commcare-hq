    Visual communication can be essential in scanning and understanding for populations whose first language
    may not be English.  Please be sympathetic with the goal of cohesion and don’t use an icon for a purpose it
    was not intended for.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consistent iconography in any user interface is critical to creating
    a product that is highly accessible across all different levels of
    literacy. Icons may need to be localized for different cultures and languages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Good icons use <strong>simple, graphic shapes</strong> so they can be understood even at a small size.
    They have little detail. They are as <strong>universal</strong> as possible, consistent with other
    platforms.
  </p>

  <h2>Primary vs Secondary Icons</h2>
  <p>
    Primary icons are used for <strong>navigation</strong> or <strong>interaction</strong>.
    Primary icons are interactive, they change the surround environment or data. They likely don’t need to be coupled with text.
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondary icons <strong>provide clarity</strong>.
    Secondary icons are used <strong>before</strong> text to communicate topical information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of HQ's icons come from
    <a href="https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/cheatsheet/">FontAwesome</a>.
    All icons in FontAwesome are already built into HQ.
    Other icons have been custom created for HQ.

  <h2>New Icons</h2>
  <p>
    If a suitable icon doesn't exist in FontAwesome or HQ's custom set,
    another great resource for icons is the
    <a href="http://thenounproject.com/">Noun Project</a>.
    Typically, once a Noun Project icon is chosen,
    it is best practice to add that icon as a glyph in the CommCare HQ font.
  </p>
  <p>
    On a Mac, the best program to edit this font is
    <a href="http://www.glyphsapp.com/">Glyphs</a>. You should open the
    <code>CommCareHQFont.glyphs</code> file in Glyphs and add your fonts to an available
    private unicode space.
  </p>
  <p>
    Glyphs has a great article on
    <a href="http://www.glyphsapp.com/tutorials/creating-an-icon-webfont">creating an icon webfont</a>.
    If you are adding a new glyph, this is a must read. Below are some
    highlights of the process.

  <div class="media">
    <a class="media-left pull-left"
       href="{% static 'styleguide/bootstrap3/images/font_docs/vector_version.png' %}">
      <img width="100" src="{% static 'styleguide/bootstrap3/images/font_docs/vector_version.png' %}" />
    </a>
    <div class="media-body">
      <h4 class="media-heading">Edit the icon in a vector graphics program first</h4>
      Open the svg or eps file in either Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape and
      make any fine edits necessary to make the icon fit the style of
      the rest of the icons available to the CommCare HQ Font.
    </div>

  <div class="media">

    </a>
    <div class="media-body">
      <h4 class="media-heading">Create a new private domain glyph in the CommCare HQ Font</h4>
      Open <code>corehq/apps/hqwebapp/_fonts/commcarehq_font/CommCareHQFont.glyphs</code>
      in Glyph.app and follow the steps in the
      <a href="http://www.glyphsapp.com/tutorials/creating-an-icon-webfont">tutorial</a>
      to add a new glyph in the private domain. Make sure the unicode
      address you've chosen does not overlap with any existing glyphs or
      public domain characters.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <a class="media-left pull-left"
       href="{% static 'styleguide/bootstrap3/images/font_docs/glyphs_character.png' %}">
      <img width="100" src="{% static 'styleguide/bootstrap3/images/font_docs/glyphs_character.png' %}" />
    </a>
    <div class="media-body">
      <h4 class="media-heading">Edit the New Glyph</h4>
      Copy your vector graphic into the Glyphs glyph editor. Resize as necessary
      so that the glyph is large enough to fit in with the rest of the HQ fonts.
      Make sure that the <code>L</code> and <code>R</code> values in the glyph info
      are never negative (ideally they are both 0).
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <a class="media-left pull-left"
       href="{% static 'styleguide/bootstrap3/images/font_docs/glyphs_compare.png' %}">
      <img width="100" src="{% static 'styleguide/bootstrap3/images/font_docs/glyphs_compare.png' %}" />
    </a>
    <div class="media-body">
      <h4 class="media-heading">Check the Glyph's Scale and Width</h4>
      A good way of checking whether your new glyph is sized properly
      is to look at it in the Glyphs overview pane and compare it to the
      existing glyphs in the font. Make sure that the baseline (bottom of the
      glyph) looks natural and that the scale and height of glyph fit with
      the rest of the glyphs in the font.
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2>Saving the Edited Glyphs File</h2>
  <p>
    Once you've added your new glyph, you will need to export your font
    to <code>*.otf</code>. Check <code>Use Production glyph names</code> and
    <code>Remove Overlap</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Update: <code>Remove Overlap</code> caused the bottom half of the
    CommCare flower to be removed. Un-checking that setting seemed to
    generate better results. YMMV
  </p>
  <p>
    Save the final <code>*.otf</code> font to
    <code>corehq/apps/hqwebapp/static/hqwebapp/font/CommCareHQFont-Regular.otf</code>.
  </p>
  <h2>Prepping the Font for Cross Browser Compatibility</h2>
  <p>
    To make the font universally readable across most browsers, you'll need
    to have an <code>eot</code>, <code>svg</code>, <code>ttf</code>,
    and <code>woff</code> version of it. Use the
    <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator">Font Squirrel Webfont Generator</a>
    to do this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are some screenshots of settings for the font generator in
    <strong>Expert Mode</strong>:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="{% static 'styleguide/bootstrap3/images/font_docs/font_squirrel_settings.jpg' %}">Settings</a><br />
      NOTE: unlike in this settings image, select <strong>No Subsetting</strong>.
      Otherwise the private use glyphs will be removed
      (<a href="http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/a/17426">source</a>).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Copy the resulting <code>eot</code>, <code>svg</code>, <code>ttf</code>,
    and <code>woff</code> files to <code>corehq/apps/style/static/style/font/</code>
    when you are done.
  </p>
  <h2>Adding the New Glyph to the Stylesheet</h2>
  <p>
    Add a reference to the icon's font unicode value as a variable in
    <code>corehq/apps/style/static/hqwebapp/less/font-commcare/variables.less</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Add the <code>:before</code> styling for the class of the icon in
    <code>corehq/apps/style/static/hqwebapp/less/font-commcare/icons.less</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use your new icon! <i class="fcc fcc-fd-signature"></i>
    <code>&lt;i class="fcc fcc-fd-signature"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code>
  </p>
