    When reaching for a modal, first consider if you can communicate this message in another way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Modals are disruptive, confusing, poorly accessbile, blocking the userâ€™s interaction, hard to escape,
    used as a junk drawer, frustrating on small screens, and add to congitive load.
    Consider non-modal dialogs on empy screen space, go inline, expand elements or use a new page.
    If you must use a modal, make sure it is <strong>easy to close, single purpose, short, and
    accessible.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    There are lots of alternatives to modals. Most of the time, if you need to confirm an action, material
    design suggests instead offering an option to undo. This still gives a user an option to reverse an
    action, but it does not interrupt their flow and increase their congitive load.
