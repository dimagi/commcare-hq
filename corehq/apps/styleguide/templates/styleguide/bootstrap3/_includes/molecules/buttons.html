    Customers have expressed frustration when figuring out where "the right" button is in CommCare: there are too many options.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most buttons shoud use the "call to action" indigo (see <a href='{% url 'styleguide_atoms' %}#atoms-colors' target='_blank'>guidance on colors</a>).
    This color is used <strong>only</strong> in this fashion on HQ, which establishes a pattern and
    makes buttons easier to identify.
  </p>
  <p>
    Primary buttons are solid indigo (<code>.btn-primary</code>), while secondary/tertiary buttons use an
    outline style (<code>.btn-default</code>).
    Most pages have a single primary action - often save, download, or add - and may have multiple secondary or
    tertiary buttons. The names are to suggest what level of importance the button has to the user.
    If you have a row of buttons (4+), please reconsider the design.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a primary button is on a dark background or a vibrant blue, the "call to action" indigo looks washed
    out. In these areas, use cyan (<code>.btn-info</code>). This is done in form builder.
    The login/signup workflows also use slightly
    different button colors, because those pages have a color scheme more like that of dimagi.com than of HQ.
    If working in one of these areas, match the existing color palette and button conventions.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use a subset of the buttons provided by Bootstrap and restyle some of them.
    We avoid <code>.btn-success</code> and <code>.btn-warning</code>, but we do use <code>.btn-danger</code> for destructive actions like
    deleting or archiving objects. We use <code>.btn-info</code> occasionally, either for primary actions on dark
    backgrounds as described above or for secondary actions that are a download.
