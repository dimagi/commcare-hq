    HQ has many different interactions for selecting data from a list.
    The best of these are toggles (for short lists) and select2 (for long lists).
  </p>
  <p>
    For any user-defined data, it's difficult to be certain how many items will be in the list.
    Even data sets that we might expect to be small - such as the number of forms in a module -
    might be large for certain projects. It's better to assume that a list will grow large and
    display it as some kind of dropdown where the options are a click away, rather than to
    assume it'll stay small and display all options on the page.
  </p>
  <h2>Toggles</h2>
  <p>
    On the occasions when a list is guaranteed to be short (2-5 items), consider displaying it as a toggle.
    This shows all options and only takes one click to select.
  </p>
  <p>
    HQ has a custom toggle widget that uses
    <a href='https://knockoutjs.com/documentation/component-overview.html' target='_blank'>Knockout Components</a>
    and is conceptually the same as a single-select dropdown.
    See
    <a href='https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/hqwebapp/static/hqwebapp/js/components/select_toggle.js' target='_blank'>select_toggle.js</a>
    for full documentation.
    There's also a <code>SelectToggle</code> widget for use with Django forms, defined in
    <a href='https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/ab80b0017c12eb7fddb54bb20b2a186b07e8294f/corehq/apps/hqwebapp/widgets.py#L140-L160' target='_blank'>hqwebapp's widgets.py</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A few places in HQ use the same look and feel as the select toggle widget but have unique implementations.
    They generally use bootstrap's
    <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#btn-groups' target='_blank'>button groups</a> and
    also often include our own <code>.btn-group-separated</code> class,
    which separates the buttons so they're easier to read and they wrap better.

  <h2>Select2</h2>
  <p>
    For most lists, select2 is the way to go. It adds behavior to a normal <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element.
    It supports either hard-coded static options or dynamic options fetched via ajax. It can support free text
    options, acting like an autocomplete, or can restrict users to a specific list of options.
    Beyond these major options, select2 supports many more specific features and styling options; see
    the <a href='https://select2.org/' target='_blank'>full documentation</a> for details.
  </p>
  <p>
    We instantiate select2 in a number of different ways: directly in javascript, via several different
    knockout bindings, and by using CSS classes that certain javascript modules search for. We also have a
    number of sets of select2 options for common behaviors like validating email addresses, displaying form
    questions. Before you add a new custom set of select2 options, look around and ask
    around for other parts of HQ that have similar behavior.
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap3/example_html.html' with slug='select2' title='Select2' content=examples.selections.select2 %}

  <h2>Multiselects</h2>
  <p>
    This is a custom widget we built. It can be useful in situations where the user is adding/removing
    items from a list and wants to be able to see both the included and excluded items.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's more complicated than a dropdown and takes up much more space. <strong>Be cautious adding it to new
    pages</strong> - be sure that the visual weight and potential learning curve is worthwhile for the workflow
    you're creating.
  </p>
  <h4>Optional Properties</h4>
  <p>
    In addition to the optional title properties, the following properties can be useful in situations where more
    control is needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <dl>
      <dd>
        <strong>disableModifyAllActions</strong> - defaults to false, useful when the preferred workflow is to disable
        the ability to select and remove all items at once
      </dd>
      <dd>
        <strong>willSelectAllListener</strong> - provides an opportunity to execute code prior to all items being
        selected
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </p>
  {% include 'styleguide/bootstrap3/example_html.html' with slug='multiselect' title='Multiselect' content=examples.selections.multiselect %}

  <h2>Other selection interactions</h2>
  <p>
    There are several other interactions used on HQ to select items from a list. In general, these should be
    avoided for the following reasons:
  <dl>
    <dt>Standard HTML select elements</dt>
    <dd>
      There's nothing inherently wrong with these, but since so many dropdowns use select2,
      select elements without this styling create visual inconsistency. It should typically be trivial to
      turn a standard select element into a select2. Standard dropdowns do interfere with usability when their
      list of options gets long - with 15+ items, it becomes difficult to find and select an item - so long lists in
      particular should be switched to select2.
    </dd>
    <dt>Lists of checkboxes</dt>
    <dd>
      Like standard HTML select elements, there's nothing inherently wrong with these, but because we
      don't use them often, they're bad for a consistent user experience.
    </dd>
    <dd>
    </dd>
    <dt>At.js</dt>
    <dd>
      <a href='https://github.com/ichord/At.js/' target='_blank'>At.js</a> is a library for mentioning
      people in comments. It's the basis for easy references in form builder. Form builder also uses it
      for autocomplete behavior (form builder doesn't have select2 available). A couple of places in HQ
      also use it for autocomplete behavior, which is not ideal. It was initially introduced in HQ
      because it was visually lighter weight than the legacy version of select2. However, as we move away
      from legacy select2, there isn't a need to use it as an autocomplete.
