    Keep tables scannable and think about how big they might get.
  </p>
  <p>
    When adding a table, first consider the nature the information you're displaying.
    Tables are best suited to tabular data, so if that's not what you're working with, consider other design
    options.
  </p>
  <p>
    To increase scannability:
  <ul>
    <li>Remove uncessary design</li>
    <li>Don't stretch tables</li>
    <li>Align headings with data</li>
    <li>Align to the decimal point</li>
    <li>Use whitespace</li>
    <li>
      Keep small screens in mind, consider
      <a href='https://css-tricks.com/rotated-table-column-headers/' target='_blank'>oblique headers</a>
      (headers at a 45-degree angle)
    </li>
    <li>In languages that read left to right, left-align text and right-align numbers</li>
  </ul>

    Most of our tables use hand-crafted markup based on Bootstrap's styles. Some areas of CommCare,
    particularly reporting, use
    <a href='https://datatables.net/manual/' target='_blank'>DataTables</a> and are tightly integrated
    with the python code that generates the data. The remainder of this section is primarily relevant to
    Bootstrap tables.

  <h2>Basic Tables</h2>
  <p>
    To control column spacing, use the <code>.col-(xs|sm|mg|lg)-[0-9]</code> classes provided by
    <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/#grid' target='_blank'>
      Bootstrap's grid system
    </a>.

  <h2>Scaling Tables</h2>
  <p>
    Most tables of user-created data will, at least for some
    projects, grow to a point where they should support a summary, pagination, and possibly searching.
    Your table doesn't necessarily need all of these, but consider how users are likely to use your
    table and manipulate the data in it.
