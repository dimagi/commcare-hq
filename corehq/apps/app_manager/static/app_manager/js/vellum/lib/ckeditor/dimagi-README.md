How to recreate
=====

Go to the [CK build editor](http://ckeditor.com/builder).

Use the following plugins:
* clipboard (for drag and drop)
* entities
* floatingspace
* undo (for change events)
* widget
* [config helper](http://ckeditor.com/addon/confighelper) (for placeholder support)

If by chance this hasn't been updated you can also check build-config.js in
lib/ckeditor/
