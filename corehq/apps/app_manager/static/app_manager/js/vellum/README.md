Vocabulary
----------

Some of the names used in the source code are less than intuitive. Hopefully
this list will help to reduce the confusion. The list is ordered with the least
intuitive items first.

- **Vellum**: also known as the _Form Builder_.
- **Mug**: an object representing a question. Each mug has a type: _Text_,
  _Date_, _Audio_, etc. While some mug type names match the corresponding label
  used in the UI, some do not. For example, a _Trigger_ is called a _Label_ in
  the UI.
- **JavaRosa**: the language/translation module. A core part of the JavaRosa
  module is the **IText** system, which provides an API for translated strings
  and multimedia used to adorn questions.
- **Widget**: a control or group of controls displayed on the right side of the
  screen and used to interact with mug properties.
- **Plugins**: features that are not part of the core are implemented as plugins.
  The plugin architecture is loosely based on the
  [JSTree](https://www.jstree.com/plugins/) plugin system. Many very important
  components are implemented as plugins, so just because something is a plugin
  does not mean it is a second-rate feature.

Usage
-----

Checkout the source from [GitHub](https://github.com/dimagi/Vellum)

Optionally, build an optimized version

```sh
$ make # artifacts will be in _build dir and also vellum.tar.gz
```

Then load it on a page using [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org), optionally with
an existing jQuery instance:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/bootstrap.css"></link>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/vellum/style.css"></link>
<!-- optional, if using bundled jquery et al -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/vellum/global-deps.css"></link>

<!-- 
Optionally reuse existing jQuery instance with Bootstrap.  
If not present, bundled versions will be loaded.  -->
<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script src="bootstrap.js"></script>

<script src="require.js"></script>
<script>
    require.config({
        packages: [
            {
                name: 'jquery.vellum',
                location: "/path/to/vellum/src"
            }
        ]
    });

    require(["jquery.vellum"], function () {
        require(["jquery"], function ($) {
            $(function () {
                $('#some_div').vellum(VELLUM_OPTIONS);
            });
        });
    });
</script>
```

See
[here](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/app_manager/templates/app_manager/v1/form_designer.html)
and `tests/main.js` for example options usage.

Vellum targets modern browsers.  IE8 and earlier are not supported.

Tests
-----

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js 14.x installed and are using `node 14.x` in your working directory (tip: manage multiple versions of node.js with nvm)

Make sure you have `npm 7.x` installed (`npm install npm@7`)

### Running Tests

Make sure everything is up-to-date:

```
$ yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

Test in a browser:
```
$ npm run testserver
$ chromium-browser http://localhost:${VELLUM_PORT:-8088}
```

By default, the test page will load the non-built version unless a `built`
parameter is present in the query string.

Commands to run tests headlessly (make sure `npm run testserver` is called in the background):
```
./test
```

or to run a specific test:
```
./test "Name of specific test"
```

a block like the following:
```
describe('the test', () => ...
  describe('with this condition', () => ...
    it('passes', ...)
```
would be referenced as `the test with this condition passes`.
So the final command would be:
```
./test 'the test with this condition passes'
```
