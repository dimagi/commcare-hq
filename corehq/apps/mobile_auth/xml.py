    <!-- @domain: Exactly one. The client should only accept keys from domains that match the request -->
    <!-- @issued: Exactly one. An ISO8601 timestamp from the server which denotes the date and time that the key requests were processed. This is the value that should be provided as the {{{last_issued}}} parameter to future requests. -->

        <!-- @valid:  Exactly one - The first date on which this key should be trusted -->
        <!-- @expires:  At Most one - A date on which the key was supplanted. If expires is not present, the phone will assume that it is currently valid -->
        <key_record valid="" expires="">
            <!-- Exactly One: A unique ID for this key. The same key record can be issued to multiple users (for superuser functions, etc). -->
            <!-- @title: At most one. An optional description of the sandbox, to allow differentiating between different datastores -->
            <uuid title=""/>
            <!-- Exactly One: The key content. Should be Base64 Encoded -->
            <!-- @type: Exactly one. The type of key being shared. Currently only AES256 is supported as either (AES, AES256) -->
