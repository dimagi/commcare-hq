    Get fixture locations using expand_from criteria

    There may be ambiguities in location type configurations that could
    cause undefined outcomes:
    - expand_from_root = TRUE seems to do the same thing as
      include_without_expanding IS NOT NULL (redundant config?).
    - expand_from_root = TRUE with expand_from IS NOT NULL seems logically
      inconsistent. Suggest adding check constraint to prevent this state.
    - include_without_expanding IS NOT NULL with expand_from IS NOT NULL
      seems logically inconsistent. Suggest adding check constraint.
    - expand_from could point to a location that is not an ancester
    - expand_to could point to a location that is not a descendant (maybe
      doesn't matter since it's only used to calculate a depth).
    - two location types along the same path could both have expand_to set
      to different levels, making the expansion depth ambiguous if a user
      had both of those locations.
    - ancestors could be excluded with improper include_only config.
      seems like we could achieve the same thing with expand_from/expand_to
