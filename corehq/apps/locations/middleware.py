    Many large projects want to restrict data access by location.
    Views which handle that properly are called "location safe". This

    have such a restriction. If these users do not have an assigned location,
    they cannot access anything.

    This middleware also sets the property can_access_all_locations. This
    property does not imply domain level authentication or access to any
    particular feature. All it says is that whether or not the user has a role
    which restricts their data access by location.
