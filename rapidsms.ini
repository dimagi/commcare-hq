# RapidSMS configuration file.

# -- RAPIDSMS
#
# The main configuration of the RapidSMS server. It contains a list of
# apps and backends to run, which can be names of app classes, or (in the
# case of multiple apps or backends of the same type) names for apps of
# the same type (see APPS and BACKENDS sections below).
#
# apps=[app1,app2,app3,...]         * comma-separated list of apps to load
# backends=[backend1,backend2,...]  * comma-separated list of backends to load

#
# In this area you can define configurations for individual applications. The app
# must be listed under the section [rapidsms] in "apps". If no configuration is
# listed for your app it will use the default parameters. However, if you wish to
# run two apps of the same type, you MUST define configure them explicitly here.

# -- Custom Django
# This section is for custom django attributes.  These are things that need to be 
# appended to your settings, as opposed to the [django] section below, which totally
# overrides your settings.  Right now the only thing this allows you to do is
# specify some additional middleware with the "middlewares" key.  This should be
# a comma separated list of middlelware paths, e.g.:
# middlewares= myapp.middleware.custom.MyAppMiddleware,myapp.middleware.other.OtherMiddleware

# -- DJANGO
#
# In this area you can define configuration options for django that would usually
# go into your settings.py file. There's no need to make the variables uppercase
# also do not specify strings by surrounding them with the quotes " or '. This
# is automatically taken care of before injecting it into django's core configuration
