CommCare HQ in Production
=========================

This is a complete guide for setting up a production deployment of CommCare HQ
on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.  It has only been tested on 32-bit Ubuntu.

Doing this highly discouraged unless you have a specific reason for not using
CommCareHQ.org, because it requires a lot of knowledge and work to set up, let
alone keep up-to-date with new features and bugfixes.

The steps used here are almost identical to those used by india.commcarehq.org,
which is a single-server deployment of CommCare HQ.  For more complicated
deployment needs, contact Dimagi.

### Create a new superuser

Log in to your server and create a new superuser to run CommCare HQ and its
helper processes:

    sudo adduser cchq
    sudo adduser cchq sudo

### Install dependencies

As any superuser, run the following commands in order to install all of the
dependencies for HQ.  As noted at the top of install.sh, you need to download
the tar.gz for the latest JDK 7 for your architecture from
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html and save the
file as `jdk.tar.gz` in the same directory before running `install.sh`.

    wget https://raw.github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/master/install.sh
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh

If the script asks you to choose a Java installation, be sure to select the
option for `/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0`.

### Create a CouchDB database

    curl -X PUT http://localhost:5984/commcarehq


### Define a server configuration

Now, switch to your local machine.

First we'll install Git and [Fabric](http://fabfile.org), which lets you manage
your remote deploy by running commands over SSH.

    sudo apt-get install git python-pip
    sudo pip install --upgrade pip
    sudo pip install fabric

You should clone the official CommCare HQ repo located at
https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq in order to modify the configuration for
your server.  You can either create a fork on Github or just clone the repo and
maintain a fork locally.

    git clone git://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq.git
    cd commcare-hq

Next, edit `fabfile.py` to add a new task definition for your server:

```python
@task
def myserver():
    env.environment = 'myserver'
    env.sudo_user = 'cchq'   # change this if you used a different username
    env.hosts = ['<my server ip>']
    env.user = prompt("Username: ", default=env.user)
    env.django_port = '8001'

    _setup_path()

    env.roledefs = {
        'couch': [],
        'pg': [],
        'rabbitmq': [],
        'sofabed': [],
        'django_celery': [],
        'django_app': [],
        'django_public': [],
        'django_pillowtop': [],
        'formsplayer': [],
        'remote_es': [],
        'staticfiles': [],
        'lb': [],
        'deploy': [],

        'django_monolith': ['<my server ip>'],
    }
    env.roles = ['django_monolith']
    env.es_endpoint = 'localhost'
```

Replace both occurrences of `myserver` above with a name for your deployment
and both occurences of `<my server ip>` with the IP address of your server.

### Create Postgres user and database

Now we will run our first fabric task. For all fabric tasks, be sure to specify
the name of the user you created above when prompted for a username.

This will prompt you for a password to create a `cchq` Postgres user (or
whatever username you have specified as `env.sudo_user`), and create a
`commcare-hq_myserver` database on the remote server by SSH-ing in and running
the necessary commands.

   fab myserver create_pg_user
   fab myserver create_pg_db


### Set up code checkouts, virtualenvs, and apache config

This will clone the codebase on the remote server, set up a virtualenv for
all of the necessary Python packages, and install them.  Then it will create and
enable an Apache configuration file that makes Apache handle requests for static
files and delegate the rest to the Django process.

   fab myserver bootstrap

### Edit localsettings.py

Log in to the remote server as the user you created and edit
`/home/cchq/www/myserver/code_root/localsettings.py` to set your Django database
settings.  The relevant part should look something like this (where `myserver`
is the name you used above):

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'commcare-hq_myserver',
        'USER': 'cchq',  # change this if you used a different username
        'PASSWORD': '<password you used in create_pg_user',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432'
    }
}

COUCH_HTTPS = False
COUCH_SERVER_ROOT = '127.0.0.1:5984'
COUCH_USERNAME = ''
COUCH_PASSWORD = ''
COUCH_DATABASE_NAME = 'commcarehq'
```

Also make sure that the directory or directories containing `LOG_FILE` and
`DJANGO_LOG_FILE` exist and are writeable by the cchq user.

The default localsettings is configured for HTTPS.  We don't currently provide
any support for setting up the SSL certificates required to use HTTPs. Most
things will work without changing these settings, but some things will break if
you have HTTPS configured without an SSL certificate.  In order to avoid this,
edit `localsettings.py` and ensure that `DEFAULT_PROTOCOL` is `http` and not
`https`.

### Sync HQ with databases

While still logged in to the remote server, navigate to `code_root/` and execute
all of the commands from [Set up your django environment](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq#set-up-your-django-environment) 
in the main README, except instead of `./manage.py`, use the full path of the
Python binary for the production virtualenv.  For example:

    /home/cchq/www/myserver/python_env/bin/python manage.py syncdb --noinput

Note that for the touchforms localsettings, it should correspond to whatever
`env.django_port` is for the environment you added the the fabfile, so
`localhost:8001` in this instance.

Once you have a completed `localsettings.py` (the one in `code_root`, not the
one in `touchforms/backend/` mentioned in the README), be sure to copy it to
`/home/cchq/www/myserver/code_root_preindex/localsettings.py`.

### Configure Supervisor

We use [Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/) to start and manage all of the helper
processes for HQ.  Supervisor and its upstart script are automatically installed
by `install.sh`, but we need to configure supervisor with our process
definitions.  To do this, edit `/etc/supervisord.conf` on the remote machine and
replace the last two lines

    ;[include]
    ;files = relative/directory/*.ini

with

    [include]
    files = /home/cchq/services/supervisor/*.conf

Then run

    sudo supervisorctl reload

### Start HQ

Back on your local machine, run the following from your local checkout:

    fab myserver preindex_views
    fab myserver deploy

The last part of the deploy (services_restart) will fail due to our inability to
reproduce some implicit fact about our production setup on CommCareHQ.org that
allows it succeed there.  To deal with this, just log in to the remote server
and run the following after every deploy:

    sudo supervisorctl stop all
    sudo supervisorctl update
    sudo supervisorctl reload
    sudo supervisorctl start all

You can see the status of all HQ processes by running `sudo supervisorctl status`.
Some processes which aren't necessary in a single-server deployment may have
failed because we didn't bother to set them up.

### Congrats!

You now have a working production installation of CommCare HQ.  

There may be additional changes necessary to `localsettings.py` in order to
enable certain features like SMS sending.  

See the bottom of the README for instructions on how to enable building CommCare
mobile apps from CommCare HQ (remember to use the full path to the Python binary
for the code_root virtualenv when running manage.py commands).
