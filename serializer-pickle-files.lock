# This file was automatically generated by running `make serializer-pickle-files.lock`.
# The purpose of this file is to prevent people from innocently adding new usages
# of serializer='pickle' in celery @task declarations, since such usage is considered deprecated in this project.
# As we remove usages, this file will be updated to reflect that and prevent unintended backsliding.
