COMMCAREHQ TOUR
===============

The first step in using this site is to become familiar with the navigation links.

|nav|

* Dashboard is an overview of recent activity in the system.
* Charts_ provides intuitive graphs and visualizations of data collected. 
* `Schemas and Reports`_ is where you register CommCare XForms and where you can see individual submissions broken down by form type.
* Submissions is a list of all the forms submitted to this system so far.


Dashboard
---------
The dashboard is the first screen that appears when you log into CommCareHQ. It provides a quick overview of the recent activity of your users. Try clicking on 'last week' or 'last 3 months' to get a sense of how many submissions we have received from your users.

Charts
------
Charts provide an easy way to visualize the data in the system. They make it easy to manage CommCare users as well as patients and cases directly. 

* Hover your mouse over "Program Management" if you are interested in community health worker activity.
* Hover your mouse over  "Patient Management" if you are interested in patients and cases.

You will then see a list of available graphs. Click on whichever one you are interested in...

Schemas and Reports
-------------------
This is where you can view all the reports in the system broken down by form type. If you decide to modify or create new xforms for CommCare, you can also register them with CommCare on this page.

For more information, read `Schemas and Reports`_.

Submissions
-----------
Most users interested in examining forms as they arrive should use the "Schemas and Reports" tabs. However, on the rare occasion when you need a little more information, you can navigate to the "submissions" page. This is a list of all the raw, unprocessed data submitted to the system, including a variety of technical details useful for troubleshooting.
