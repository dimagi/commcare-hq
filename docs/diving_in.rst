Diving In
=========

The quickest way to get a feel for the code is to work in it. To do that, let's look at where things are.


Navigating The Codebase
-----------------------

The core CommCareHQ functionality is in the ``corehq/`` directory. 
Once-off projects are in ``custom/``. And this documentation lives in ``docs/``.


A Django App
------------

This documentation assumes that you are familiar with Django. 
CommCare HQ currently uses `Django 1.7`_.
Check out its documentation for more information about what a Django project is, and what a Django app is, if you
are not sure.
