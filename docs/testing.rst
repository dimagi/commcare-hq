======================
Testing infrastructure
======================

Tests are run with `nose <https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man.html>`_.
Unlike many projects that use nose, tests cannot normally be invoked with the
``nosetests`` command because it does not perform necessary Django setup.
Instead, tests are invoked using the standard Django convention:
``./manage.py test``.

Nose plugins
============

Nose plugins are used for various purposes, some of which are optional and can
be enabled with command line parameters or environment variables. Others are
required by the test environment and are always enabled. Custom plugins are
registered with `django-nose <https://github.com/dimagi/django-nose>`_ via the
``NOSE_PLUGINS`` setting in
`testsettings <https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/testsettings.py>`_.

One very important always-enabled plugin applies
`patches <https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/tests/noseplugins/patches.py>`_
before tests are run. The patches remain in effect for the duration of the test
run unless utilities are provided to temporarily disable them. For example,
`sync_users_to_es <https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/util/es/testing.py>`_
is a decorator/context manager that enables syncing of users to ElasticSearch
when a user is saved. Since this syncing involves custom test setup not done by
most tests it is disabled by default, but it can be temporarily enabled using
``sync_users_to_es`` in tests that need it.


======================
Testing best practices
======================

Test set up
===========

Doing a lot of work in the ``setUp`` call of a test class means that it will be run on every test. This
quickly adds a lot of run time to the tests. Some things that can be easily moved to ``setUpClass`` are domain
creation, user creation, or any other static models needed for the test.

Sometimes classes share the same base class and inherit the ``setUpClass`` function. Below is an example:

.. code:: python

    # BAD EXAMPLE

    class MyBaseTestClass(TestCase):

        @classmethod
        def setUpClass(cls):
            ...


    class MyTestClass(MyBaseTestClass):

        def test1(self):
            ...

    class MyTestClassTwo(MyBaseTestClass):

        def test2(self):
            ...


In the above example the ``setUpClass`` is run twice, once for ``MyTestClass`` and once for ``MyTestClassTwo``. If ``setUpClass`` has expensive operations, then it's best for all the tests to be combined under one test class.

.. code:: python

    # GOOD EXAMPLE

    class MyBigTestClass(TestCase):

        @classmethod
        def setUpClass(cls):
            ...

        def test1(self):
            ...

        def test2(self):
            ...

However this can lead to giant Test classes. If you find that all the tests in a package or module are sharing
the same set up, you can write a setup method for the entire package or module. More information on that can be found `here <http://pythontesting.net/framework/nose/nose-fixture-reference/#package>`_.

Test tear down
==================

It is important to ensure that all objects you have created in the test database are deleted when the test
class finishes running. This often happens in the ``tearDown`` method or the ``tearDownClass`` method.
However, unneccessary cleanup "just to be safe" can add a large amount of time onto your tests.


Using SimpleTestCase
====================

The SimpleTestCase runs tests without a database. Many times this can be achieved through the use of the `mock
library <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/>`_. A good rule of thumb is to have 80% of your tests be unit
tests that utilize ``SimpleTestCase``, and then 20% of your tests be integration tests that utilize the
database and ``TestCase``.

CommCareHQ also has some custom in mocking tools.

- `Fake Couch <https://github.com/dimagi/fakecouch>`_ - Fake implementation of CouchDBKit api for testing purposes.
- `ESQueryFake <https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/es/fake/es_query_fake.py>`_ - For faking ES queries.


Squashing Migrations
====================

There is overhead to running many migrations at once. Django allows you to squash migrations which will help
speed up the migrations when running tests.
