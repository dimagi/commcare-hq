External Packages
=================

This page discusses how to add new dependencies with yarn. Be cautious
of adding new dependencies, which introduce an indefinite maintenance
burden.

Yarn
----

Yarn can manage components that contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts or
even image files. Yarn doesnâ€™t concatenate or minify code or do anything
else - it just installs the right versions of the packages you need and
their dependencies.

Yarn packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yarn packages can be installed from a variety of sources, including a
registered yarn package (a repo that has a ``package.json`` file
defined), a Github shorthand (``<user or org>/<repo_name>``), a Github
URL, or just a plain URL that points to a javascript file.

When you install a package, it will be installed in a directory called
``node_modules``. For example if you were to run ``yarn add jquery``,
you would find a directory ``node_modules/jquery``.

Specifying packages in ``package.json``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure a package gets installed for a project, you must specify it in
the ``package.json`` file. This is equivalent to the
``requirements.txt`` file for ``pip``. Similar to ``pip install`` for
python, for yarn, use ``yarn upgrade`` When specifying a yarn package
you can use many techniques. Here are a few examples:

.. code:: js

   // Installs the jquery package at version 1.11.1 to `node_modules/jquery`
   "jquery": "1.11.1"

   // Because `jquery-other` does not refer to a yarn package we must specify it in the
   // versioning. Yarn will install this package to `node_modules/jquery-other`.
   "jquery-other": "npm:jquery#1.2.0"

   // This will install jquery from a github hash
   "jquery-github": "jquery/jquery#44cb97e0cfc8d3e62bef7c621bfeba6fe4f65d7c"

To generalize, an install declaration looks like this:

::

   <name>:<package>#<version>

Where ``<package>`` is optional if ``<name> == <package>``. A package
can be any of these things:

======================= ===================================
Type                    Example
======================= ===================================
Registered package name jquery
Git endpoint            https://github.com/user/package.git
Git shorthand           user/repo
URL                     http://example.com/script.js
======================= ===================================

There are more, but those are the important ones. Find the others
`here <https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/package-json>`__

A version can be any of these things:

============= =================
Type          Example
============= =================
semver        ``#1.2.3``
version range ``#~1.2.3``
Git tag       ``#<git tag>``
Git commit    ``#<commit sha>``
Git branch    ``#<branch>``

Using Yarn packages in HQ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use these packages in HQ you need to find where the js file you are
looking for. In the case of jquery, it stores the minified jquery
version in ``jquery/dist/jquery.min.js``:

::

   <script src="{% static 'jquery/dist/jquery.min.js' %}"></script>

Note: The ``node_modules`` bit is intentionally left off the path.
Django already knows to look in that folder.
