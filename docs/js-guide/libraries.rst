Third-Party Libraries
=====================

This page discusses when to use the major, UI-framework-level, libraries
we depend on, along with a few common code conventions for these
libraries.

jQuery
------

`jQuery <https://jquery.com/>`__ is available throughout HQ. We use
jQuery 3.

Prefix jQuery variables with a ``$``:

::

   var $rows = $("#myTable tr"),
       firstRow = $rows[0];

Underscore
----------

`Underscore <http://underscorejs.org/>`__ is available throughout HQ for
utilities.

Knockout
--------

`Knockout <http://knockoutjs.com/>`__ is also available throughout HQ
and should be used for new code. We use Knockout 3.0.

Prefix knockout observables with an ``o``:

::

   var myModel = function (options) {
       var self = this;
       self.type = options.type;
       self.oTotal = ko.observable(0);
   };

…so that in HTML it’s apparent what you’re dealing with:

::

   <input data-bind="visible: type === 'large' && oTotal() > 10, value: oTotal" />

   Current total: <span data-bind="text: oTotal"></div>

Backbone and Marionette
-----------------------

`Backbone <http://backbonejs.org/>`__ is used in Web Apps. It **should
not** be used outside of Web Apps. Within Web Apps, we use
`Marionette <http://marionettejs.com/>`__ for most UI management.

Yarn
----

We use `yarn <https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/>`__ for package
management, so new libraries should be added to
`package.json <https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/package.json>`__.
