Testing
=======

Best Practices
--------------

Writing good tests in javascript is similar to writing good tests in any
other language. There are a few best practices that are more pertinent
to javascript testing.

Mocking
~~~~~~~

When mocks are needed, use the ``sinon.js`` framework.

Setup
-----

In order to run the javascript tests you’ll need to install the required
npm packages:

::

   $ yarn install --frozen-lockfile

It’s recommended to install grunt globally in order to use grunt from
the command line:

::

   $ npm install -g grunt
   $ npm install -g grunt-cli

In order for the tests to run the **development server needs to be
running on port 8000**.

Test Organization
-----------------

HQ’s JavaScript tests are organized around django apps. Test files are
stored in the django app they test. Tests infrastructure is stored in
its own django app, ``mocha``.

Most django apps with JavaScript tests have a single set of tests. These
will have an HTML template in
``corehq/apps/<app_name>/templates/<app_name>/spec/mocha.html``, which
inherits from the `mocha app’s base
template <https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/mocha/templates/mocha/base.html>`__.
Test cases are stored in
``corehq/apps/<app_name>/static/<app_name>/js/spec/<test_suite_name>_spec.js``

A few django apps have multiple test “configs” that correspond to
different templates. Each config template will be in
``corehq/apps/<app>/templates/<app>/spec/<config>/mocha.html`` and its
tests will be in
``corehq/apps/<app_name>/static/<app_name>/<config>/spec/``. These are
defined in ``Gruntfile.js`` as ``<app_name>/<config_name>``, e.g.,
``cloudcare/form_entry``.

Dependency Management
---------------------

Tests are one of the few areas of HQ’s JavaScript that do not use
RequireJS. Instead, dependencies are included in the relevant HTML
template as script tags.

Running tests from the command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the javascript tests for a particular app run:

::

   $ grunt test:<app_name> // (e.g. grunt test:app_manager)

To list all the apps available to run:

::

   $ grunt list

Running tests from the browser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run a django app’s tests from the browser, visit this url:

::

   http://localhost:8000/mocha/<app_name>

To run a specific config:

::

   http://localhost:8000/mocha/<app_name>/<config>  // (e.g. http://localhost:8000/mocha/cloudcare/form_entry)

Adding a new app or config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three steps to adding a new app:

1. Add the django app name to the ``Gruntfile.js`` file.
2. Create a mocha template in
   ``corehq/apps/<app>/templates/<app>/spec/mocha.html`` to run tests.
   See an example on
   `here <https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/app_manager/templates/app_manager/spec/mocha.html>`__.
3. Create tests that are included in the template in
   ``corehq/apps/<app>/static/<app>/spec/``

To add an additional config to an existing app, specify the app in the
``Gruntfile.js`` like this:

::

   <app_name>/<config>  // (e.g. cloudcare/form_entry)

The template and tests then also being in config-specific directories,
as described above.
