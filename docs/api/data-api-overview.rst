Data APIs
=========

These APIs are intended for building project-specific applications and integrations, including:

- Custom end-user applications that address project-specific needs.
- Custom integrations with external back-end systems, such as an electronic patient record system.

In the following, ``[version]`` should always be replaced with one of ``v0.4``, ``v0.3``, etc. These documents only describe the latest versionâ€”prior versions remain available only to support backwards compatibility with deployed systems, not for general use. The latest version is ``v0.5``.

You can browse and test the Data APIs using the `CommCare API Explorer <https://commcare-api-explorer.dimagi.com/>`_.

**Implementation of URL Endpoints** - All URL endpoints should be utilized as part of a cURL authentication command. For more information, please review CommCare's API Authentication Documentation: `API Authentication <https://dimagi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/commcarepublic/pages/2279637003/CommCare+API+Overview#API-Authentication>`_.
