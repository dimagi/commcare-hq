Importing cases from a remote FHIR service
==========================================

Overview
--------

CommCare can poll a remote FHIR service, and import resources as new
CommCare cases, or update existing ones.

There are three different strategies available to import resources of a
particular resource type:

1. Import all of them.
2. Import some of them based on a search filter.
3. Import only the ones that are referred to by resources of a different
   resource type.

The first two strategies are simple enough. An example of the third
strategy might be if we want CommCare to import ServiceRequests (i.e.
referrals) from a remote FHIR service, and we want to import only the
Patients that those referrals are for.

CommCare can import only those Patients, and also create parent-child
case relationships linking a ServiceRequest as a child case of the
Patient.


Configuring a FHIRImportConfig
------------------------------

Currently, all configuration is managed via Django Admin (except for
adding Connection Settings).

In Django Admin, navigate to FHIR > FHIR Import Configs. If you have any
FHIRImportConfig instances, they will be listed there, and you can
filter by domain. To add a new one, click "Add FHIR Import Config +".

The form is quite straightforward. You will need to provide the ID of a
mobile worker, location, or group in the "Owner ID" field. All imported
cases will be assigned to this ID.


Mapping imported FHIR resource properties
-----------------------------------------

Resource properties are mapped via the Admin interface using ValueSource
definitions, similar to :ref:`admin-interface-mapping` for data
forwarding and the FHIR API. But there are a few important differences:

The first difference is that FHIRRepeater and the FHIR API use
FHIRResourceType instances (rendered as "FHIR Resource Types" in Django
Admin) to configure mapping; FHIRImportConfig uses
FHIRImportResourceType instances ("FHIR Import Resource Types").

To see what this looks like, navigate to FHIR > FHIR Import Resource
Types, and click "Add FHIR Import Resource Type".

Select the FHIR Import Config, set the name of the FHIR resource type,
and select the case type.

The "Import related only" checkbox controls that third import strategy
mentioned earlier.

"Search params" is a dictionary of search parameters and their values to
filter the resources to be imported. Reference documentation for the
resource type will tell you what search parameters are available. (e.g.
`Patient search parameters`_)

"Import related only" and the "Search params" are applied together, to
allow you to filter related resources.

There is a second important difference between FHIRImportResourceType
and FHIRResourceType: With FHIRResourceType, the ValueSource
configurations are used for *building* a FHIR resource. With
FHIRImportResourceType they are used for *navigating* a FHIR resource.

So FHIRResourceType might include ValueSource configs for setting a
Patient's phone number. They might look like this:

.. code:: javascript

    {
      "jsonpath": "$.telecom[0].system",
      "value": "phone"
    }

.. code:: javascript

    {
      "jsonpath": "$.telecom[0].value",
      "case_property": "phone_number"
    }

When we are navigating an imported resource to find the value of the
Patient's phone number, we don't know whether it will be the first item
in the "telecom" list. Instead, we search the "telecom" list for the
item whose "system" is set to "phone". That is defined like this:

.. code:: javascript

    {
      "jsonpath": "$.telecom[?system='phone'].value",
      "case_property": "phone_number"
    }

The third difference is that although the mappings will look the same
for the most part, they may map to different case properties. This is
because we have found that projects often want a mobile worker to check
some of the imported values before overwriting existing values on the
case. It is wise to confirm with the delivery team how to treat case
properties that can be edited.

Configuring related resources
-----------------------------

If a FHIR Import resource type has "Import related only" checked, we
need to configure how the resource type is related.

For example, Patient resources may have associated ServiceRequests, which you
may want to import. To achieve this, you'd set up a FHIRImportResourceType for
ServiceRequests, with "import related only" checked, so only those associated
with patients in the import are fetched.

Navigate to FHIR > "Resource type relationships", and click "Add
resource type relationship".

Relationships are configured on the child resource type, with a
reference to their parent, just like a typical foreign key relationship.
Options available in this config are:

* Resource type - the type of the child or descendant resource.
* Jsonpath - the path used to identify the parent or ancestor resource.
* Related resource type - the type of the parent or ancestor resource.
* Related resource is parent - checkbox indicating whether CommCare
  should set up a parent/child index between the two cases.

.. admonition:: Example: Adding a patient service request

    First set up a ServiceRequest resource type as described in the previous
    section. Check "import related only" to only fetch those linked to patients
    in the import. Then navigate to the "Add resource type relationship" page.

    ``ServiceRequest.subject`` references the Patient it is referring.
    To set up this relationship:

    * Set "Resource type" to "ServiceRequest".
    * Set "Jsonpath" to ``$.subject.reference``.
    * Set "Related resource type" to "Patient".

    If the "Related resource is parent" checkbox is checked, then CommCare will
    create an index on the ServiceRequest case, making the Patient case its
    parent.


Testing FHIRImportConfig configuration
--------------------------------------

To make sure your configuration works as expected, add some test data to
a FHIR server, and import it.

Here is a script I used for adding test data:

**add_service_request.py:**

.. code:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    from datetime import date, timedelta
    from random import choice
    import requests
    import string

    BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8425/hapi-fhir-jpaserver/fhir/'  # ends in '/'

    GIVEN_NAMES = 'Alice Bethany Claire Deborah Eilidh Francesca'.split()
    FAMILY_NAMES = 'Apple Barker Carter Davenport Erridge Franks'.split()
    NOTE = 'Patient missed appt. Pls follow up.'


    def add_patient():
        given_name = choice(GIVEN_NAMES)
        family_name = choice(FAMILY_NAMES)
        full_name = f'{given_name} {family_name}'
        patient = {
            'resourceType': 'Patient',
            'name': [{
                'given': [given_name],
                'family': family_name,
                'text': full_name,
            }],
            'telecom': [{
                'system': 'phone',
                'value': create_phone_number(),
            }],
        }
        response = requests.post(
            f'{BASE_URL}Patient/',
            json=patient,
            headers={'Accept': 'application/json'},
        )
        assert 200 <= response.status_code < 300, response.text
        return response.json()['id'], full_name


    def add_service_request(patient_id, patient_name):
        service_request = {
            'resourceType': 'ServiceRequest',
            'status': 'active',
            'intent': 'directive',
            'subject': {
                'reference': f'Patient/{patient_id}',
                'display': patient_name,
            },
            'note': [{
                'text': NOTE,
            }]
        }
        response = requests.post(
            f'{BASE_URL}ServiceRequest/',
            json=service_request,
            headers={'Accept': 'application/json'},
        )
        assert 200 <= response.status_code < 300, response.text


    def create_phone_number():
        number = ''.join([choice(string.digits) for _ in range(9)])
        return f'0{number[0:2]} {number[2:5]} {number[5:]}'


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        patient_id, patient_name = add_patient()
        add_service_request(patient_id, patient_name)


From a Python console, run your import with:

.. code:: python

    >>> from corehq.motech.fhir.tasks import run_daily_importers
    >>> run_daily_importers()
