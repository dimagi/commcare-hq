Documenting
===========

.. This is a comment

Documentation is awesome.  You should write it.  Here's how.

All the CommCareHQ docs are stored in a ``docs/`` folder in the root of the repo.
To add a new doc, make an appropriately-named rst file in the ``docs/`` directory.
For the doc to appear in the table of contents, add it to the ``toctree`` list in ``index.rst``.

Sooner or later we'll probably want to organize the docs into sub-directories, that's fine, you can link to specific locations like so: ```Installation <intro/install>```.

For a more complete working set of documentation, check out `Django's docs directory <dj_docs_dir_>`_.  This is used to build `docs.djangoproject.com <dj_docs_>`_.

Sphinx
------

Sphinx builds the documentation and extends the functionality of rst a bit
for stuff like pointing to other files and modules.

To build a local copy of the docs (useful for testing changes), navigate to the ``docs/`` directory and run ``make html``.
Open ``<path_to_commcare-hq>/docs/_build/html/index.html`` in your browser and you should have access to the docs for your current version (I bookmarked it on my machine).

Writing Documentation
---------------------

For some great references, check out Jacob Kaplan-Moss's series `Writing Great Documentation <jkm_>`_ and this
`blog post`_ by Steve Losh.  Here are some takeaways:

* Use short sentences and paragraphs
* Break your documentation into sections to avoid text walls
* Avoid making assumptions about your reader's background knowledge
* Consider `three types of documentation <jkm_wtw_>`_:

   #. Tutorials - quick introduction to the basics
   #. Topical Guides - comprehensive overview of the project; everything but the dirty details
   #. Reference Material - complete reference for the API

One aspect that Kaplan-Moss doesn't mention explicitly (other than advising us to "Omit fluff" in his
`Technical style <jkm_ts_>`_ piece) but is clear from both his documentation series and the Django documentation,
is *what not to write*.
It's an important aspect of the readability of any written work, but has other implications when it comes to
technical writing.

Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry wrote, "... perfection is attained not when there is nothing more to add, but when there
is nothing more to remove."

Keep things short and take stuff out where possible.
It can help to get your point across, but, maybe more importantly with documentation, means there is less that
needs to change when the codebase changes.

Think of it as an extension of the DRY principle.

reStructuredText
----------------

reStructuredText is a markup language that is commonly used for Python documentation.  You can view the source of this document or any other to get an idea of how to do stuff (this document has hidden comments).  Here are some useful links for more detail:

* `rst quickreference <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_
* `Sphinx guide to rst <http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html>`_
* `reStructuredText full docs <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_
* `Referencing arbitrary locations and other documents <http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/inline.html#ref-role>`_


.. This is a normal comment

.. 
    This is a block comment, none of this will appear in the generated HTML.

    RST has basic inline markup just like Markdown, but a lot of its flexibility and extensibility come in this form:  A line beginning with two periods and a space indicates that this line is explicitly markup.

    This hyperlink target can be referred to elsewhere
    .. _my-hyperlink-target: http://www.commcarehq.org/
    .. _my-section-reference:
    These targets can also refer to sections of the document (ctrl+f for _rst)

    A similar syntax is used for code blocks:

    .. code-block:: python

        def myfn(m, n):
            return m + n

    You can also just start a code block like this::

        def myfn(m, n):
            return m + n

    Of course, none of this will show up in the html, because it's all part of the comment block (by indentation)


.. _editors:

Editors
-------

While you can use any text editor for editing RestructuredText
documents, I find two particularly useful:

* PyCharm (or other JetBrains IDE, like IntelliJ), which has great
  syntax highlighting and linting.
* Sublime Text, which has a useful plugin for hard-wrapping lines called
  `Sublime Wrap Plus`_. Hard-wrapped lines make documentation easy to
  read in a console, or editor that doesn't soft-wrap lines (i.e. most
  code editors).
* Vim has a command ``gq`` to reflow a block of text (``:help gq``). It
  uses the value of ``textwidth`` to wrap (``:setl tw=75``).  Also check
  out ``:help autoformat``.  Syntastic has a rst linter.  To make a line a
  header, just ``yypVr=`` (or whatever symbol you want).

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Some basic examples adapted from 2 Scoops of Django:

Section Header
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sections are explained well `here <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickstart.html#sections>`_ 

.. Basically, use non alphanumeric characters, the first one you use is h1, second is h2,
.. and so on.  It assumes that you're using sections, so Section 1, then 1.1, then 1.1.1,
.. without skipping a level.

Python colored code block (requires pygments):

.. code-block:: python

    # You need to "pip install pygments" to make this work.

    for i in range(10):
        like()

JavaScript colored code block:

.. code-block:: javascript

    console.log("Don't use alert()");
