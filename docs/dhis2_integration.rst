DHIS2 Integration
=================

Requirements
------------

1. Users can use CommCareHQ to manually associate information on the
   DHIS2 instance (ex. reporting organizations, user identifiers) with
   mobile workers created in CommCareHQ.

    1. Custom user data in CommCareHQ will be used to specify a custom
       field on each mobile worker called dhis2_organization_unit_id.
       This will contain the ID of the DHSI2 organization unit that the
       mobile worker (midwife) is associated with and submitted data
       for.
       The organization unit ID will be included as a case property on
       each newly created case.

2. CommCareHQ will be setup to register child entities in DHIS2 and
   enroll them in the Pediatric Nutrition Assessment and Underlying Risk
   Assessment programs when new children are registered through
   CommCareHQ.
   This will be done through the DHIS2 API and may occur as
   soon as data is received by CommCareHQ from the mobile, or be
   configured to run on a regular basis.

    1. When a new child_gmp case is registered on CommCare HQ, we will
       use the DHIS2 trackedEntity API to generate a new Child entity.
       We will also register that new entity in a new Pediatric
       Nutrition Assessment program.
       The new Child entity will be updated with the attribute
       cchq_case_id that contains the case ID of the CommCareHQ case.

    2. The Pediatric Nutrition Assessment program will be updated with
       First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Name of
       Mother/Guradian, Mobile Number of the Mother and Address
       attributes.

    3. For children of the appropriate risk level (conditions to be
       decided) we will also enroll that Child entity in the Underlying
       Risk Assessment program.

    4. The entity will be registered for the organization unit specified
       by the dhis2_organization_unit_id case property.

    5. If a CommCareHQ case does not have a dhis2_organization_unit_id

    6. The corresponding CommCareHQ case will be updated with the IDs of
       the registered entity and each program that entity was registered
       in. This will be used for later data submissions to DHIS2.

3. CommCareHQ will be configured to use the DHIS2 API and download a
   list of registered children on a regular basis.
   This will be used to create new child cases for nutrition tracking in
   CommCare or to associate already registered child cases on the mobile
   with the DHIS2 child entities and the Pediatric Nutrition Assessment
   and Underlying Risk Assessment programs.

    1. Custom code in HQ will run on a periodic basis (nightly) to poll
       the DHIS2 trackedEntity API and get a list of all registered
       Child entities

    2. For all child entities without a provided cchq_case_id attribute,
       a new child_gmp case will be registered on CommCareHQ.
       It will be assigned to a mobile worker with the appropriate
       dhis2_organization_unit_id corresponding to the organization of
       the tracked entity in DHIS2.

    3. The registered child_gmp will be updated with additional case
       properties to indicate its corresponding DHIS2 entities and
       programs.

    4. Once the case has been registered in CommCareHQ, the DHIS2
       tracked entity will be updated with the corresponding
       cchq_case_id.

4. CommCareHQ will use the DHIS API to send received nutrition data to
   DHIS2 as an event that is associated with the correct entity,
   program, DHIS2 user and organization.

    1. On a periodic basis, CommCareHQ will submit an appropriate event
       using the DHIS2 events API (Multiple Event with Registration) for
       any unprocessed Growth Monitoring forms.

    2. The event will only be submitted if the corresponding case has a
       DHIS2 mapping (case properties that indicate they DHIS2 tracked
       entity instance and programs for the case).
       If the case is not yet mapped to DHIS2, the Growth Monitoring
       form will not be processed and could be processed in the future
       (if the case is later associated with a DHIS entity).

    3. The event will contain the program ID associated with case, the
       tracked entity ID and the program stage (Nutrition Assessment).
       It will also contain the recorded height and weight as well as
       mobile- calculated BMI and Age at time of visit.
