CommCare Enhancement Proposal Process
-------------------------------------

This process outlines a mechanism for proposing changes to CommCare HQ. The process is intentionally very
lightweight and is not intended as a gateway that must be passed through. The main goal of the process is to
communicate intended changes or additions to CommCare HQ and facilitate discussion around those changes.

The CommCare Enhancement Proposal (CEP) process is somewhat analogous to the `Request For Comments`_ process
though much simpler:

1. Create a CEP

    Create a Github Issue using the `CEP template`_. Once you have completed the template submit the issue an
    notify relevant team members or **@dimagi/dimagi-dev**.

2. Respond to any questions or comments that arise
