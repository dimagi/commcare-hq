# To customize a particular deployment environment
# include another <env>.yml file in this directory
# you may use any of the following directives:
# - exclude_groups
# - include_groups
# - exclude_pillows
# - include_pillows
# those directives will be applied ON TOP of this default, _not_ instead of it
# Thus to include all pillows you'd have to have the file say
#
#   include_groups:
#     - mvp
#     - fluff
#
# *_pillows are applied before *_groups, so if your file just has
#
#   include_pillows:
#     - path.to.my.custom.fluff.pillow
#
# then that fluff pillow will be included, while all other fluff pillows
# are still excluded (because that's the default given in this file).
