Contributing to CommCareHQ
==========================

CommCareHQ is primarily developed by `Dimagi`_, but we welcome contributions.

Code Contributions
------------------
Dimagi tracks most issues internally, but we use github's `issue tracker`_
for public facing issues.  Feel free to browse the issues there and tackle
any you feel equipped to do.  When you update or add comments to an issue
please mention **@dimagiupdate** to send an alert to our internal issue
tracking system.  Before submitting a PR, review our `Code Contributions and Review`_.  You may also be interested in our `CommCare Developers`_
email group if you have questions or need feedback.

Bug Reports
-----------
To file a bug report, please follow the system outlined in our `bug
reports`_ wiki page.  You are also welcome to submit an accompanying pull
request if you are able to resolve the issue.
