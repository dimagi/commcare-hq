An XPath Parser/Generator for JavaScript using the Jison parser/generator.

Demo:

See the xpath.html file for a very simple usage for parsing xpath expressions.


Usage:

First include the libraries and xpath.js and models.js files in your document.
Then try the following to get started.

  var expr = "/some/xpath/expression"
  var parsed = xpath.parse(expr);
  var regenerated = parsed.toXPath();

For examples of supported expressions, see the tests!

Tests:

  Open test/tests.html to run tests (must be serving all files in the library).
  Individual tests are found in tests/parsertests.js and 
  tests/generatortests.js


Known Limitations:

  Filter expressions are not supported due to a known bug in jison.
  See the failing tests for examples of expressions that are known not to work.

  
Code Structure:

 xpath.js   the generated parser file.
 models.js  the underlying models files used in parsing.
 src/       contains the jison parser files.
 lib/       external libraries that the parser depends on.
 test/      qunit tests for the parser and generator.
 
Build:

This is built using jison. To build the parser file yourself run:

$ node /path/to/jison src/xpath.jison src/xpath.jisonlex

(This is only necessary if you want to edit the jison or lex files)
