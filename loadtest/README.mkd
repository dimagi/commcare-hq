##CommCare HQ loadtest
multi-mechanize load tests for CommCare HQ

Work in progress

###Running
Requires [multi-mechanize](http://testutils.org/multi-mechanize/).

Copy loadtest/config.cfg.example to loadtest/config.cfg
From the root commcare-hq directory run

    $ multimech-run loadtest

Currently has the following user profiles:

* login - logs a user in and grabs an empty report page
* submit_form - submits a simple form with a single case
* ota_restore - ota restores a mobile user
* public_landingpage - hits the public HQ landing page

Can tweak server, domain and user credentials by copying the
loadtest/test_scripts/localsettings.example.py file to
loadtest/test_scripts/localsettings.example.py and overriding the following:

    BASE_URL = 'https://staging.commcarehq.org'
    DOMAIN = "demo"
    USERNAME = "changeme@dimagi.com"
    PASSWORD = "***"
    MOBILE_USERNAME = "user@demo.commcarehq.org"
    MOBILE_PASSWORD = "***"
    OTA_USERNAME = "user@demo.commcarehq.org"
    OTA_PASSWORD = "***"

Edit config.cfg to tweak number of threads per user profile and length of test.
See multimechanize docs for more info.

### Mac OS 10.8 (Mountain Lion) Specific instructions

In order to install matlibplot, if you get an error message about
`#include"ft2build.h"` failing:
* Download and install XQuartz (http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/)
* Run `sudo ln -s /usr/X11/include/freetype2/freetype /usr/X11/include/freetype`
* Finally `sudo pip install matlibplot`

Worked for me!
